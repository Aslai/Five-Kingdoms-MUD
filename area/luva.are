`5The Headwaters of the River Luva``~
You stand on marshy soil as a wide, slow moving river carves its
way lazily around you, spanning north and south. While slow, the
water is deep blue, denoting its extreme depth, and it is well wide
enough to support the movement of tallships running routes between
Luva and the Sultanate of Jambool to the south.

The road turns yet again.  To the east the gates of Luva.  To the south
a beaten well traveled path.  Gutter ruts from carriages and wagons have
marred up the road.  Due to the nearby swampy areas, the ruts tend to stay
constantly murky and muddy.  The center of the road seems to be nice and well
packed but the occasional mud splash from horses and wagons can make this
road a little more of a pain to travel than normal.

This area is void of all material things.  The walls are as dark as
if someone had bespelled them to be this way.  The one thing that
stands out are the floor tiles that radiate a blue-black light which
barely gives off enough light to see by.  This room is known to the
temple priests as the prayer room.

Lavish items have been placed in here, objects of art, statues, tapestries
and the like. Items for that long trip to the nether world and your final resting
place to which all eventually come to have been placed here as a reminder that
the mortal world is fleeting and though you hold onto these things in life, in death
they are but trinkets.

towards the south to the left of that coffin.  The floors are of a dull
black stone that seems to absorb all light.

known to exist in Luva.  If it has been tried and tested in the heat of battle it
hangs here as a testament to the brave men and women who have taken it to
its limits for honor and glory.  With small brass plaques dedicated to those that
made best use of weapons and armor with short notes of the items qualities
embossed with raised relief letters.  The entire hall seems to be made around
these items. Just above them, hanging at angles are the pennants of all the
Cavaliers of the lands of Mirlan to glorify their family names and personal deeds.

the Berserkers are well adapted at keeping secrets and not at all as they
portray themselves to the outside world as they too indeed enjoy the finer
things in life and by the looks of the tapestries, carvings and furniture,
most definitely have an appreciation for them as well.

More of a mansion with its 15 foot high ceilings and hard marble floors.  Columns spiral up
the walls with intricately carved depictions of the gods and other mythical beasts of Mirlan.
You are in the central hall of this great mansion, a near sterile, museum-like environment.
Tapestries and paintings cover the high walls, most are family crests of the nobles of the
lands.  A purple and golden runner runs from the main entrance to the south archway and

prancing about.  Just enough light escapes through the glass to illuminate this dome
and give it a seemingly unnatural quality about it.  The floor center has a runner of
purple and gold, the colors of royalty.  The walls have pictures of natural settings such
as the woods, the beaches, mountains and other natural wonders all exquisitely done
by the great masters of brush and oil.

`8Ye Olde Shope ``~
You have stepped inside a general store full of different items
apparently for sale.  The wooden walls and floor look decrepit
and worn from age and use.  The musty smell seems to be coming
from some place upstairs as it drifts down unceremoniously to offend
the more sensitive noses.

`8a bedroom ``~
You are in the upper room of the shopkeeper Bixbie's shop.
A bed, dresser and empty clothing chest are pretty much the only
furnishings here.  A small painting of Bixbie and some other gnome
hangs on the wall.

`8Grand Healers Hospice and Guild Hall ``~
One of the more unusual buildings and guild halls of Luva this one
sports many windows which have all types of healing herbs growing
in the sill of the windows.  The light seems to have been directed to
give the maximum needed for good hearty growth.  The walls are
scripted with many different formulas and healing remedies passed
down from the ancients.  The floors of this ancient hall are a mix of
many different marbles set in intricate designs and mosaics.

`8Amathe's Chosen ``~
A holy light seems to fill this vast hall.  Amathe herself seems to have
blessed this place with good and safe tidings.  Although a humble room
it does have its vanities such as the beautiful artistically style chairs and
sofas.  A few rugs and marble toped end tables arranged for functionality
can be seen in here as well.
 
An inscription is painted just above the door way.

You are in a sparsely lit room.  The wooden walls and
flooring depict a humble yet sturdy building.  There are
wall benches that have been secured to the floors and
walls which have been engraved upon by some obscure
forgotten person.

bedrolls that seem to be permenetly placed here for the weary

`8The Holy Order of Divinity ``~
You have entered into a shrine of the gods.  One surely knows that
the divine of Mirlan have sanctified this as holy ground to the gods.  All
deities are represented here.  Including the primordial gods.  A huge tree
relief depicting the gods and their relationship to each other as well as to
the mortals themselves.  The relief is made of leafed platinum and has
been etched with such artistic work that looking at it is awe-inspiring for
all clerics of all religions.

deities of Mirlan.  Knee pillows lay strewn before the altar for those
wishing to give homage to their particular god.  The room is filled with
the smell of various incenses which have been burning in the recent past.
The whole room gives off the aura of being close to ones god.

`8House of Zarkirond ``~
It is obvious to the senses that upon entering this house that it is
dedicated more to the followers of Zarkirond.  Thieves.  While not what
one would expect off-hand the guild is ordered and structured.  Very well
kept without overt wealth.  The walls are cedar lined with hardwood flooring.
The occasional torch gives this place plenty of light to maneuver as well as
little enough light to allow shadows to dance along the walls making it difficult
to tell what is shadow and what is person.

`1a basement below ``~
You have entered a dark and dank room underground.  The granite walls
are damp with condensation.  The whole of the room gives an oppressive
and heavy sense about it.  Old dried blood stains and sings of struggle are
present upon the floor area in the south corner where shackles are secured
to the wall.  Dimly lit and sparsely furnished, this place gives the appearance
of being more than just a hideaway for thieves.

`8a tower above ``~
You have come up into a room above the sorcerers guild house.
The glass-steel windows allow for a gainful view of the outside but
its hardness and thickness prevent access through.  The room is well
lit and rather large with big relaxing chairs and sitting pillows arranged
neatly around a centered hookah which stands upon a bronze pillar.

`8The Thaumaturgist's Guild House ``~
You have entered a long hall.  Soft pale colored curtains
cover the whole of the walls.  Arcane symbols, embroidered
in a golden thread, what seem to be chaotic yet somehow
orderly. The floors appear to be made of a jade colored stone
which has been polished to a high sheen.  The high vaulted
ceilings painted with many inspirational creatures and scenes.

You have entered a large commons room above the main hall
of the thaumaturgist guild house.  Wall benches line the west
and east walls and a large stack of bunk beds line the north.
Six stacks six high give plenty of resting room to those that are
in need of some rest.  
 
There is a table with a dozen or so chairs which look rather
old but in very good condition.

`1An underground passageway``~
A passage running north and south, slippery and littered with
sharp rocks.  Dangerous to traverse even by the surest of foot.
The cavern walls have a sickly yellowish-white lichen growing
upon them that move slightly towards you as you pass.

the east.  Odd formations of rocks pop up here and there as if
at one time this used to be an underground river bed and the
rocks have been molded and shaped by flowing water.

a struggle to make it through, squirming and re-arranging gear
to make it is needed.  The oppressive feel of the ground above
is enough to drive many insane.

`7The Portal Room``~
You stand inside the Portal Room of the Mar'Kyer Alchemists.
The rooms around the realm all look pretty much the same,
as these little crafty gnomes have setup quite a business
for themselves. The room is rounded, with a small hexagram
inset into the floor in the center of the room. The rest of
the room is entirely empty except for a small chair where
the alchemist sits, and a small sign on the wall, with some
trade common writing on it.

`%---=== THE MAR'KYER PORTAL SYSTEM ===---``
--
If you'd like to travel somewhere, we're the best! Once the 
portal is created, just "enter portal" to be transported to your
location. Items can be passed as well through the portals. Just
give the item to the portal. Remember, they only stay open for 
a short time. Only one portal may be opened at a time. We 
serve the following locales:
--
`^DARGOTH, ZALANGO, REVELSPORT, ULSYM, LUVA, and EMMEREAUX``
--
Just `#SAY`` the location you wish to portal to, and your monies
will be taken by the Alchemist.
--
Thank you for using the Mar'Kyer Portal System!
