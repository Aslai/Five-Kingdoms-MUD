Zalango Shahnate guard~
an Shahnate Guard~
An Shahnate guard is here, patrolling the wet streets.
~
Regal and proud this guardian's armor seems to be covered with the
same patina that the rest of the guards bear. He serves the Shahnate
of Zalango proudly, despite the bad reputation the guards in this
area have for taking bribes and exercising brutality.

Ghregory~
Ghregory, the Emporium's head merchant stands here, dusting a display case.
~
Although his skin is weathered, and his hair is sparse and gray,
Ghregory's hands are nimble for one of his age.  He constantly flips a small
silver coin between them, flipping it over and under each finger in rapid
succession.  He is dressed quite nicely considering the layer of grime that
seems to cover everything in this city, and wears a loose, leather cap atop
his head.  A pair of blue eyes sparkle beneath a set of thin glasses,
scouring his shop for would-be thieves.

Xavier is here overseeing the loading and unloading of his smuggling ships.

Long since retired from the fishing trade, Xavier now oversees his fleet
of smuggling ships that pass into and out of Zalango. He is massive,
with deep set scars in his face that show a long history of armed combat
and the telltale signs of a hard lived life. He occasionally barks orders
to the dockworkers in a thick baritone voice that seems to somehow drown
out the cries of seagulls and the chatter of other voices around the docks.

An ancient drow stands before you, his face wrinkled and 
the gray hair thinned out.  You judge him to be ancient even

delicate. He works deftly with his tools, punching holes in
some wet, skinned hide that seems to come from...something
sapient. He notices your entrance, and turns his attention
to you.

`7Central Common``~
Here is the black heart of Zalango.  A baroque fountain, once grand
but now choked with refuse, stands here.  Three marlins rise from the
central portion of the fountain on their tails, their mouths agape.  Water
trickles down their length to pool in the basin below.  Every so often a
spurt of foul smelling water erupts from them, dousing anyone nearby.

`7Northern Plaza``~
You are standing near the black heart of Zalango.  Black and pale blue tiles
form a checkerboard here.  The plaza is thronged with citizens going
about their daily routines, sailors headed towards the docks, and a host
of unsavory looking characters who seem to measure you as you pass.  To
the north looms a brooding black edifice, its spires clawing into the sky.

of red brick, pitted with age and neglect.  Small piles of refuse litter the
ancient blue and ebony tiles of the place.  Shouts and the hubbub of daily
life echo in from the east and south.

The plaza here is choked with crowds hurrying eastwards into the heart
of Zalango.  Wagons rattle by at high speed, headed towards the docks
to the east.  The western edge of the plaza is lined with tottering buildings
of red brick.  Once grand, they now lie under the weight of the years,
their wooden roofs sagging and covered with gull droppings.

Less traffic flows through the portion of the plaza.  The blue and black
tilework here is worn and ill-cared for.  Small sere weeds poke their heads
up through the latticework of cracks.  Local tinkers sit with blankets
spread before them, holding a miscellany of cheap wares.  A facade of red
brick buildings like the plaza here to the west and south.

Long rows of red brick tenement homes form the eastern and southern
boundaries of the plaza here.  Neglect over the centuries has reduced 
their once fine splendor to decrepitude.  The pale blue and polished black
paving stones have been worn under the heels of countless passerbys.
Weeds grow up through cracks between the tiles, waving in the gentle
breeze.

exchanging words with hard eyed women.  A line of weathered brick

taut ropes punctuated with an occasional crash are heard to the east.

portcullis, firmly closed against the wilderness beyond.

made of red brick line the streets, many crumbling with age or covered with
a green shade of algae from the balmy sea air.  To your north a large
porticullis denotes the northern gate of Zalango.

The cobblestones here are sunken into two parallel ruts from the weight
of the wagons which constantly traverse its length.  Towering buildings of
brick rise to either side and clotheslines stretch between them.  Billowing
white sheets flap from them in the freshening sea breeze.  To the west lies
a brick archway, beyond which can be seen a large open area.

creating a dark tunnel.  Inside, scruffy men sit propped against the walls,
drinking from thick bottles of emerald green glass.  Beyond the tunnel the
street opens up again and you can hear the soft echoing of the sea lapping
around pilings.

An open gate pierces the wall to the west beyond which can be seen the
tall masts of ships at anchor.  In the square before the gate teem sailors,
dockmen, and whores, all vying for trade.  Wagons stand ready to load
the cargo from the docks beyond.  Loud cries of wheeling gulls mingle
with the grunts of laborers and the creaking of wagons.

You are approaching the center of the city.  To the north runs a cobbled
street while southwards lies a rutted dirt road.  All around you rise
worn buildings of red brick that seem to sag under some oppressive
weight.  Eastward the road passes through an archway between the
buildings.  On the other side is a large open air plaza, choked with people.

their faces showing patches of pale green moss.  To the east you can see
a busy thoroughfare.

`7Beneath the Western Ramparts``~
You stand beneath the towering gate of the western wall of Zalango.
Twin stairs climb to either side of the gateway, allowing soldiers to mount
the walls in times of siege.  Narrow arrow slits pierce the wall here,
turning the open area here into a murderous killing ground.  From the
south comes the brash braying of mules and high whinnying of horses,
punctuated occasionally with the deep roar of some unknown beast.

In front of each is a small porch, decorated with shells, driftwood, and
other bounty from the sea.  Nets hang from their railings, in obvious need 
of mending.  The rich smell of bouillabaisse simmering fills the air and 
makes your stomach growl.

allowing soldiers to mount the ramparts above.  A brisk
breeze swirls around, carrying the odor of fish and tar.

East lies the seaward wall of the city and you can catch
the sounds of breakers rolling in.

here, paralleled on the other side by the stone height of the eastern wall of
Zalango.  Three stories in height, each has an iron balcony the runs the
entire length of its face.  Women whose dress shows some degree of
prosperity walk along the street here, carting bundles of goods from the

It seems likely that the red brick homes to the west are the domiciles 
of the city's sea captains.  Although age and the effects of the salt air has
weathered them, their once grand faces still appear imposing.  Each has
an iron widow's walk encompassing its upper stories though most are
stained with blotches of chalky white sea gull droppings.

`7Northern Seaside Road``~
The smell of the sea is strong as you walk down the cobbles of this 
narrow street.  Any view to the east is obscured by the bulk of the city wall
but along the western edge of the lane rise several ornate houses of red
brick.  Their upper stories are surrounded by iron widow's walks.  A
massive white sea gull perches on one's railing, eyeing you as if you might
make a tasty snack.

`7Beneath the Northeastern Bastion``~
A small grassy green is located here at the corner of the eastern and
northern city walls.  Although pocked with weeds and bits of rubbish, it
is the closest thing to a clean area you have seen in this city.  A stone
stairway climbs the western wall here, from which you can ascend the
top of the city walls.

`7Eastern Larken Road``~
The top of a gloomy brooding mansion rises above the height of a brick
wall along the southern side of the cobbled way.  A massive gate of
twisted black iron bars is set firmly in the gate, secured to the wall with
a length of soldered iron chain.  The top of the wall is set with jagged
iron spikes, their upper length wickedly barbed.
 
A rusted, weathered sign hangs on the rusty gate here.

`7Eastern Larken Road``~
In the wide spot where the two roads converge at the base of the northern
wall of the city several tinkers have gathered.  One busily turns a grindstone
while his companion holds a knife against the wheel, showering out a
cascade of sparks while a woman looks on.  Several other ladies stand
nearby, holding a collection of domestic cutlery.

A wooden scaffolding has been erected against the city wall to the north.
Blocks of cut stone stand stacked nearby and a group of muscled men
sits on the ground with their backs against them, passing a emerald-green
glass bottle between them.  From the porches of the red brick homes across
the street women yell at the workers, but they appear not to take any

malingers in front of the row of decrepit red brick buildings to the south.
Each has a strip of brilliant red cloth tied around his right bicep, the ends
fluttering as he moves.   They seem to size you up as you pass by.

on their broad faces, saying nothing.

within the seaweed, dying from suffocation.

lilypads.  A thick wooden drawbridge spans the moat, its timbers covered
in slimy growths of algae.  One iron chain runs from the drawbridge into
the gate beyond while the other hangs limply down into the moat.  A
iron nailed portcullis stands firmed closed, barring entry into the city.

`8The Clerical Guildhouse``~
You stand in a great hall, its pillars rising up dozens of feet to support
the vaulted ceiling overhead.  It stretches on to the south into the depths
of the building.  To the east a high pointed archway allows access to a
room beyond.

`8The Clerical Guildhouse``~
Darkness cloaks the far end of this hall, making everything within appear
shadowy and surreal.  Sounds are muted and thin, seemingly coming from
a great distance.  A piteous shriek breaks the still, causing your teeth to
ache.  The sound comes from a short post and lintel doorway to the east.

An iron spiral staircase wends its way upward in the center of the room.
The monotonous sounds of chanting filter in from above and the air carries
the thick smell of incense.

This long rectangular hall is dark and its atmosphere oppressive.  Even
the firepit burning halfway down its length seems to add to the pall rather
than dispel it.  A choked sobbing echoes down from above and the air
carries the stench of suppuration and misery.

running sores and his crazed eyes fever bright.  A semi-circle of people
in black robes before him gaze on his misery in calculated interest.  A
gangrenous odor fills the chamber.

Robed and hooded acolytes kneel here, their voices droning on in paeans 
to the divinities of Mirlan.  The air chokes you, full of the sweet stench
of burning herbs mingled with the fumes of smoldering dung.

cavorting briefly before vanishing with a pop.  A fine rain starts, ceasing
a second later.  Reality bends and fluxes here under the strain of those
imposing their will upon it.

Unlike the entrance area, this portion of the tower is still and quiet.  Few
people move through here and those that do scurry by, hunched over as if
draw as little attention to themselves as possible.   From the archway to
the east comes a slight scent of decay.

on it.  A shriveled mummy, its bandages half wound exposing the
desiccated face and torso, occupies the central table.  Shelves, holding
canopic jars of bronze, stone, and clay, line the walls of the chamber.  A 
ripe brown reek rises from a bin of body parts, awaiting attention.

sizzles around you.  The ground actually lurches a bit under your feet.  An
iron staircase, running with white-blue sparks, winds its way upward into
the tower.

help rope lay nearby.  Gazing out from the bastion you can see miles of
trackless wasteland, barren and empty.

operating such a machine is evidenced by the dried blackened stains

Expanding about forty feet or so in front of you is a long
ago dug moat, its edges slowly creeping farther out,
devouring all in its path, you see a dilapidated boat 
somewhere in the middle slowly being consumed by the great
mass of the water.  A thick rainbow oily residue coats the
smooth ripples of the water and from the depths you almost
see a pair of glowing red eyes sizing you up.

here, but you can still make out the crocodiles swimming
restlessly. A crocodile swims by with a leg protruding
from its mouth.  You hear seagulls cry in the distance.

`4The Northern Zalango Moat``~
There is a putrid smell rising from the bowels of the moat,
the fog lets the odor linger and permeate the land.  The
mangled cat tails droop and the grass is a dank gray here.
You can barely see your hand in front of your face due to
the heavy fog.

`4The Northern Zalango Moat``~
As you blindly press on, the fog remains thick, making the
air smolder in your lungs.  Snakes slither across the marsh
making it seem as though it is constantly moving.  The sky
is grey and overcast, lending a dismal appearance that leaves
little hope in the soul and mind.

`4The Northern Zalango Moat``~
The fog is finally starting to lift a bit, yet there still
is no sunlight, only the dismal gray of the overcast skies.
The moat here stretches about sixty feet across, where the
thick black water laps hungrily at the crumbling shores.  A
few crocodiles have made their way to the edge of the water
and are inspecting the shore.

`4The Northern Zalango Moat``~
You see a moat before you that stretches about fifty feet
accross, the water a thick, oily black, the surface choppy
and rough.  A putrid smell permeates the air and hangs heavy
in the thick fog.  A layer of steam rolls over the heaving
surface of the water.

`4The Northern Zalango Moat``~
A forty foot moat stretching before you filled with putrid,
murky waters.  In the bowels of the water, you see glowing
red eyes glaring hungrily at you.  Sunk deep into the water
are two crumbling concrete arches, one on either side of the
moat.  Through the heavy fog, you can make out a building and
perhaps the outline of a solid wooden drawbridge just south
of you.

stone blocks scattered around, half buried beneath the thick mud and
brackish water.  Several small turtles sunning themselves, become nervous
at your approach and slid down rocks into the water with a splash.

Tall weeds line the banks of the moat, its edges crumbling
easily into the thick murky water.  There appears to be quite

inspection leads you to realize that those logs are rather
large crocodiles.  They eye you hungrily as you pass.

sulpher.  The ground is soggy here and you notice you feet

moat spills into the vast sea in front of you.  The thick
fog only allows you to see about thirty or so feet in front
of you, all of it nothing but seemingly endless sea.  The
wind here is merciless, however the putrid odor that hangs
about is finally swept out to the sea with the oily black
water of the moat.

water swirling and churning causing brown foam to cap the crests
of the choppy waves.  Many crocodiles have swarmed to the center
of the moat.  The scent of death is strong here.

banks.  There is a large splintered wood drawbridge embedded
into the towering city walls.

Screams of pain and cries of terror reverberate off of the cold, wet
stone walls of this pit.  Patches of grey-green mildew grow sporadically in
the cracks of the unevenly hewn stone, and rivulets of water run down their
length and collect in stagnant pools at your feet.  The air is thick with
the metallic stench of blood and the sour smell of brimstone.  Ahead the
light of dozens of flickering candles casts eerie shadows on the walls
around you.

molten silver, the ground within it is pitted and charred from what may be

in crude iron fittings, their smoke choking the air and obscuring vision. 
Large chunks of yellow stone smolder at each of the pentagram's five points.

implements of torture are arranged around the room, most of them occupied
unwillingly.  A large iron grate is set into the floor and what seems to be
an unending torrent of flowing blood pours into the drain.  The metallic
smell of blood is its greatest here, and uneases your stomach as you breathe
it in.  A single iron grate above your head allows light to enter this
forboding realm.

here holds many lengths of polished wood, ranging from the length of a
forearm to the height of a man.

than it is.  Shelves line the walls and hold a vast assortment of small
white sculptures.  You can see mermaids, ships, anchors, and gulls, just
to name a few.  Twin beds rest against the northern wall and a small
wooden table lies between them.

`8A Warehouse``~
The tunnel under the bridge ends in what appears to be a room full of
crates of perfectly legitimate trade goods (honest!)  .  Numerous crates
labeled "Silk", "Hay" and "Fishing Hooks" line the walls in neat, orderly
stacks.  Looking more closely, a stack of six crates are set into the wall
with hinges and have a handle bolted onto the front.  A door?

`8A Hidden Office``~
This small, cramped room is furnished only with a table and three chairs.
The table is littered with bounty reciepts, gold coins and knives.  A
dartboard hangs from the eastern wall, and is impaled by a handful of steel
darts.  A short hallway leads south out of the room.

The floor of this room is mostly occupied by a large, circular table and
a dozen or so chairs.  Bounty reciepts, ledgers and coins are stacked in
neat, orderly piles and a bullitein board hangs from the southern wall.  On
the board charicitures of prominent figures have been tacked up, some marked
with a checkmark, some with an "X" and some with the word "Cleaned" written
over them.

`8Armory``~
The air is stale and hot here from the long forge that burns along the
rear wall of the shop.  Hanging from hooks and pegs along the walls are
a variety of weapons: saw toothed knives, barbed harpoons, and thick 
oaken belaying pins.  His huge frame running with sweat, a massive man
pulls a length of glowing metal from the forge with iron tongs and begins
to pound it against an anvil.

`8Bedroom``~
An enormous bed, its head and foot boards of black ironwork, occupies
the center of this room.  Soiled leather garments lie heaped in mounds on
the floor and the entire place smells of soot and old sweat.  Closed
latticework shutters mute the sounds of the street below.

`8The Alchemist's Shop``~
The low ceiling of this shop is palled with a roiling haze
of sharp grey smoke.  The only light comes from a tripod
bronze brazier that burns with a steady blue flame.  As the
alchemist works, she throws pinches of shimmering dust into
the fire, causing it to flare up in a brilliant azure flash.

`8Bedroom``~
The tiny room here is an utter shambles.  It looks as if a
strong wind blew in the open shutters, scattering everything
inside.  Clothes hang out of open chests or lie in soiled
heaps on the floor.  A stack of precariously balanced dishes,
crusted with the remnants of a week's worth of meals, totters
on a nightstand.

`8The Portal Room``~
You stand inside the Portal Room of the Mar'Kyer Alchemists.
The rooms around the realm all look pretty much the same,
as these little crafty gnomes have setup quite a business
for themselves. The room is rounded, with a small hexagram
inset into the floor in the center of the room. The rest of
the room is entirely empty except for a small chair where
the alchemist sits, and a small sign on the wall, with some
trade common writing on it.

`%---=== THE MAR'KYER PORTAL SYSTEM ===---``
--
If you'd like to travel somewhere, we're the best! Once the 
portal is created, just "enter portal" to be transported to your
location. Items can be passed as well through the portals. Just
give the item to the portal. Remember, they only stay open for 
a short time. Only one portal may be opened at a time. We 
serve the following locales:
--
`^DARGOTH, ZALANGO, REVELSPORT, ULSYM, LUVA, and EMMEREAUX``
--
Just `#SAY`` the location you wish to portal to, and your monies
will be taken by the Alchemist.
--
Thank you for using the Mar'Kyer Portal System!

`8Hayloft``~
At the top of the ladder lies a tiny hayloft, musty with the smell of old
mildewing hay.  Opposite the ladder stands an old bed, its mattress split
and sagging.  A pair of shutters covers an opening over the street and a
rope hangs from a pulley depending from the ceiling beam.

`8Stables``~
The air inside this long wooden structure is thick with the odors of hay
and sweat.  Closed stall doors lie to either side and you can hear the
sounds of their occupants moving around.  A ladder rises up along the
back wall of the stable and urchins scurry up and down it on their errands.
 
A large sign swings from two hooks in the ceiling beam.

`8The Harbormaster's Office``~
You find yourself amid a large, spacious nautical room. On the walls,
several brass placards denotion merits, licenses, or awards are placed
haphazardly, some corroded by the salty air. Several large desks are
around the room covered with chart books and loose maps, while several
plotters and sextants line the sills. Two large bay windows oversee the
docks, while a massive man observes the activity in the wharf.

`8Slate's Tattoo Parlor``~
You stand within a dimly lit room in what would certainly be
considered the 'bad' district of Zalango. Around you several
large sheets of parchment line the walls, each with strange bits
of art painted on them. You hear the clicking of a taphammer on
a needle and look over to see a very large man working over a
sailor who has a rather pained expression on his face.
 
A large sign is placed on the far wall with large lettering.

`8The Tannery``~
As you enter this squalid shop, your legs buckle against the
awful reek.  The stretch of harsh chemicals mingles with the
crisp acrid taint of urine, causing your eyes to water.  A
number of skinnig knives, their length clotted with hair and
tissue, lie haphazardly on scarred tabletops.  Vats burble 
nearby, softening the hides into leather.

A huge circular table of oak occupies the center of this

only the dimmest of illumination.  Several old rusted locks
and iron keys are scattered around on a shelf bolted to the
wall.
