The only guildmaster not of the duergar race in this dark city, Ghrogden
appears to be quite a formidable warrior making it quite obvious why he was
chosen to be guildmaster.  Weapons are strapped almost to every part of his
body, covering most of what would be his unarmored body.  Quite tall even
for one of the stone giant race, he stands uncontested amongst the short
duergar students.

A large fountain carved of the finest marble rests in the center of the
pond.  Five dolphins stand on end facing out, connected at their backs, with
water shooting from their mouths.  Standing atop the dolphins, seemingly
floating on air, is the statue of a beautiful woman with long flowing hair. 
Her arms spread slightly at her side, her breasts covered with large
seashells.  Where her legs should be is a long, powerful looking tail,
similar to those of the dolphins.  Upon her head rests a crown, from it
water sprays in all directions, joining with the water of the dolphins to
ripple the surface of the pond.

feathered fletching hangs to dry on hooks in the wall, while a small
metalworking forge is here to craft heads for the projectiles.

echo off the unyeilding stone walls and wooden shelves that line nearly
every square foot.  Laden with thick tomes, each row is set with a gilded
steel ladder, mounted upon rails that permit the ladders to be moved freely
about.  A large number of oaken tables, each illuminated by an ornate brass
candlebra are scattered neatly around the room, set with a pair of chairs.

You stand on a slender marble and steel bridge crossing the center of the
Newander Pond and around the massive fountain.  All around you is water and
wildlife, as fish swim and jump for food and ducks and swans paddle around
dunking their heads to eat and wash.  The large marble fountain sprays water
through the air in all directions from the center, rippling the surface of
the pond, yet leaving the bridge you stand upon untouched.  North of where
you stand, you are able to see a large, marble building standing in the
sparse light that manages to wriggle through the canopy here.

`7The Portal Room``~
You stand inside the Portal Room of the Mar'Kyer Alchemists.
The rooms around the realm all look pretty much the same,
as these little crafty gnomes have setup quite a business
for themselves. The room is rounded, with a small hexagram
inset into the floor in the center of the room. The rest of
the room is entirely empty except for a small chair where
the alchemist sits, and a small sign on the wall, with some
trade common writing on it.

`%---=== THE MAR'KYER PORTAL SYSTEM ===---``
--
If you'd like to travel somewhere, we're the best! Once the 
portal is created, just "enter portal" to be transported to your
location. Items can be passed as well through the portals. Just
give the item to the portal. Remember, they only stay open for 
a short time. Only one portal may be opened at a time. We 
serve the following locales:
--
`^DARGOTH, ZALANGO, REVELSPORT, ULSYM, LUVA, and EMMEREAUX``
--
Just `#SAY`` the location you wish to portal to, and your monies
will be taken by the Alchemist.
--
Thank you for using the Mar'Kyer Portal System!

`8A small shadow filled room``~
You stand in a small shop, almost tiny when compared to the other
buildings and offices in Ulsym. It is dark, dank and musty. A 
thick layer of smoke hangs in the air. A small table is set up in
the rear of the shop, and behind it sits a rather shady looking man.

lead towards the Royal Ulsym Palace.

`7Temple of Purity``~
You stand amid the Temple of Purity and Sacrifice. This temple is 
massive, and looms over Abbey Way. Its spires can be seen for many
miles, large white spires of ivory that extend towards the heavens. An
aura of pure white light surrounds this temple, as if those who build it
put a glyph of protection from evil on it.

Strong smell of hay and horse manure assails your nose as you enter the
huge stables.  Row upon row of stalls are all filled with various mounts
from lowly asses to mighty warhorses.  Carefully avoiding the dung on the
ground you can make your way out north.

`8Stable Stall``~
This is a small stable stall.  There is lots of hey and strong odour of
horses in the air.

`7The Great Stairs``~
You are at the bottom part of The Great Stairs, a massive flight of
stairs hewn from rough granite and shaped into a giant platform leading into
the upper terraces upon which the Palace is built.  You can spot the many
windowed palace up and north of here, the great merchant banners of Ulsym
unfolded in the wind.

`7Before the Royal Palace``~
You are in near proximity to the sprawling estates of the Ulsym Palace.
Huge stone faade looms above you, its walls covered in various banners of
merchants lords of Ulsym.  A steady stream of officials and traders
streams along the Great Stairs along with a few city guards and patrols. 
South and down lie the Great Stairs while north of you is the Royal Palace.

`8The Foyer``~
This room is the only well-kept room in the entire hall.  The walls are
hung with intricate tapestries depicting wars and battles of historical and
mythological signifigance, each labeled with the outcomes, strategies and
precursors.  Large iron sconces hold the torches that illuminate the room,
casting dancing shadows all about.  Ahead the smell of blood and the sound
of battle fills assaults your senses.

`8The Pit``~
To put it simply, this room is little more than a huge pit set into the
floor surrounded by a large fence.  Benches and chairs ring around the pit,
in various stages of repair, and many turned over on their side in the
commotion.  Spectators watch as bloody fights are staged in the pit, holding
fists full of coins and shouting, jeering and cursing the participants with
every breath.  Large pools of blood have collected on the pit's floor.

`8The Warmaster Armory``~
You are in a middle of a small armory stacked ceiling high with every
sort of weapon known in Mirlan.  From longswords, shortswords, gladiuses
and daggers all the way to massive claymores and war flails this room has it
all.  Quiet a few of them still have some blood on their business ends.

`8The Wounded Yak``~
This rather small room has been hastily converted into a bar of sorts,
but the excitement from the pit has taken over.  The few remaining chairs
and tables here are scarred and pitted from repeated blows, cuts, stabs, and
burns.  Littering the floor are the sad, pathetic remains of the less than
fortunate pieces of furniture not quite strong enough to endure the drunken
onslaught of the tavern's patrons.

`8The Sanctuary of Meditation``~
This room is quite unlike any other in the clan hall for one simple
reason...  It is deathly quiet.  Even the ruckus that is no doubt going on
downstairs is muted entirely.  The walls are heavily padded and thick, heady
smokes emenates from a single steel brazier in the middle of the room. 
Large, soft pillows are thrown about everywhere to calm and relax the room's
occupant for whatever reason they may need to be calmed and relaxed.

`8Stairs Above the Library``~
A small oaken stairway curls its way up into the dark and dusty depths of
the library.  Layers of scrolls, tomes and ancient manuscripts litter the
ground.  Large shelves line the walls of the tower, tended by numerous
acolytes climbing impossibly high ladders.

`8Library Second Floor``~
You stand on the second floor of the Libary of Mirlan surrounded by the
collected wisdom of countless years and even more countless tons of dust. 
It swirls and dances around you only to meet its final end in the flame of
the strange flame-less torches set in the walls.

`8The Precipice``~
This chamber is furnished curiously, with odd articles that you have
never seen before.  Wierd misshapen furniture, and oddly angled fixtures
seem to defy gravity itself with the way they stand.  The glass that
surrounds the room is tinted a curious blue color and through it, splendid
waves of energy flow, intertwining with everything they pass.  The floor is
bare, and appears as stone, yet is warm and cushioned to the touch.

`8The Eastern Node``~
This chamber mirrors the same odd furnishings, but lacks the large
windows of the central room.  With little more than comfortable chairs and a
few misplaced tomes occupying it, the room is most likely used for study or
meditation.  It has obviously been magically silenced, as even the sounds
you make seem muted.

The room and the passage leading south dazzles with splendor.  Rich
carpets lines the ground with exotic tapestries and cloths draping the
walls.  The ceiling painted in various frescos positively teams with color. 
Sounds of laughter and music echo down the passage.

`8Respledant Opulance``~
Whomever constructed this room has spared no expense for luxury's sake. 
Immense apholstered couches and large fluffy pillows litter the ground, each
with a wide ottoman.  Stained glass lamps rest on exquisite beachwood
endtables illuminated with magical glowstones housed in intricate brass
fittings.  Fresh flower arrangements send exotic perfumes into the air
mingling with the scent of fine tobacco and finer liquor.  Finely dressed
people mill about lazily, relaxing and being tended to by the staff of
attendants present.

`8The Dining Hall``~
The silence of this relatively quiet room is broken only seldomly by the
sound of sterling silver utensils rapping on lead crystal goblets.  Fine
china flatware is arranged flawlessly around the large mahogany table
accented by imported silverware and elven-silk napkins.  A perfectly carved
ice sculpture stands in the middle of the table, enchanted to prevent
melting away into nothingness.

`8The Kitchen``~
The hustle and bustle of this room is dizzing after leaving the confines
of the dining hall.  Scores of waiters, chefs and maitre de's scurry about
the room, their arms laden with food, dishes, and pitchers.  The activity is
accented by the occasional crash as two people slam into each other, sending
their burden crashing to the floor in a shower of splintered porcelain and
crystal.  It is no doubt that this room houses the finest collection of
chefs in the world.

`8The Sitting Room``~
This room smells of fine tobacco and perfume.  Relatively small
bookshelves rest against the walls, obviously posing as decorationg rather
than for practical usage, seeing as how the ancient first edition books that
rest in them are for the most part, untouched.  A walk-in humidor has been
set into the far western wall, and a luxurious white piano rests beneath a
chandelier on the northern.  The piano is being played by a rather slender
elven child, its chords singing a relaxing melody.
