a bandit scout~
A bandit scout charges towards you, mounted on his horse!
~
These are the vanguard, as well as the eyes and ears of
what is commonly called the 'raider army.'  The mounted
cavalry, so to speak, of their organization, their job is not
only to provide information to the main raider camp, but also
to get rid of any lone travellers that might stumble upon their
base.  That seems to be you.

A man, surrounded by blinding light, hovers in the air here.  Great
white wings stretch out from his back, keeping him afloat with steady
thrusts.  His face is wreathed in an ambience of such intensity that
features can not be discerned.  Silvery chainmail covers his form,
and grasped within his hands is a massive, glowing glaive.

`3Entrance to the Gap``~
You stand at the entrance to a large chasm.  The land around you
is rather bleak, with little sign of life.  To both sides, the Lesser Raider
Mountains rise, tall and majestic.  The Gap itself stretches far off into
the distance, snaking a way through the mountains.  The path is marked
with many footsteps in the dust, despite the lack of life, all of them north.

`3Entering the Gap. ``~
The sun beats down on you, with no cover or shade in sight.  The land
around you is dry, with little or no vegetation to be seen.  A somewhat
bedraggled bush with drooping leaves is the only living thing in sight.
To both sides, steep mountain walls loom.  The only ways for you to go
is southwards towards the Lowlands, or north towards the heart of
Raider's Gap.

`3A Small Outpost ``~
A small group of Raiders have been set here, apparently to act as scouts
for anything entering the Raider's Gap from the Lowlands to the south.
Seeing you headed towards them, two of them immediately charge
towards you, while a third gallops northwards, probably hoping to 
report your presence to main force.
 
To the east, there seems to be a small door, almost hidden by a giant
boulder.

side.  This seems to be the private hoard of the three raiders you saw
earlier.  It appears as if they had been skimming some of the earnings from
recently captured caravans.

roadside, but little else.  You can distantly hear the sound of the Esterian
Raiders laughing loudly far, far off in the distance, accompanied by
screams.

place, whipping up small clouds of dust everywhere.  There is no
living thing in sight, be it flora or fauna.  The path continues to the
south or northwards.

`3A Branching``~
The trail splits into two directions here, one to the east, and one to the
west.  Many footprints seem to be headed westward, from where you
can hear screams.  The path eastward seems, in contrast, more peaceful
for some reason, and you get the feeling that no one would bother you
there.

`3To A Peak ``~
The trail of footsteps which you have seen on the trail for so long does
not seem to have passed by in this direction.  It appears that, for some
reason, the raiders do not often visit this area.  Glancing upwards at the
mountain, you see why.  Even though strategically, this may be a good
place to lay an ambush, practically, it's too hard to move a large group
of people on horseback here.  The path is too narrow and restricting, not
to mention the fact that it is extremely sheer in some areas.

`3Remains of a Caravan ``~
As you continue to travel westward through the Gap, you come face to
face with a horrifying sight.  In front of you, lies the remains of a
completely destroyed caravan.  The wagons are still smoldering slightly,
having been fired after all the valuables and horses were removed.  A few
dead bodies lie on the ground, seemingly hacked in several different places
by Raider blades.  The rest of them have been, no doubt, captured and taken
northwards to serve both as hostages as well as slaves.

`3The Base of an Upwards Trail ``~
The trail here takes a sharp upward swing, going straight up for a
considerable distance.  Far upwards, a hint of green can be seen, in contrast
to the stark, bare Gap road to the west which you just left.  There's actually
some plants and other shrubs in this area, it seems.  But in order to get to
it, if that's your intention, it looks like there's a long, long climb ahead of you.

`3An Upwards Trail ``~
As you begin your climb up the mountain, you can't help but notice the
clean, crisp atmosphere around you.  The air blows gently on your face,
and it feels nice and cool, unlike the rest of the Gap.  Some few plants can
be seen around you for a change, adding a welcome bit of green color to the
surrounding area.  Far away, upwards and to the north, you can see the
summit, to where you are considering hiking to.

`3On the Side of a Mountain ``~
This trail is so steep that calling it a trail at all would be a complete
joke.  It is more like a sheer wall, standing tall and ominously before you,
almost daring you to try and climb it.  At first glance, it seems to be almost
impassable.  Upon closer examination, however, a gridline of cracks and
indentations can be seen, which would allow a persistent, dedicated climber
to slowly crawl his way up the cliff.
 
You seem to see a slight crack in the face of the wall.  Perhaps there's
something behind it.

`3Nearing the Peak ``~
As you finally manage to scramble over the edge of the sheer wall face, you
note with growing despair that the climb still is not over.  To the north, yet
another mountainside looms before the pinnacle is reached.  This one, however,
seems to be somewhat less steep, you notice with a sigh of relief.  Far to the
north, the sounds of flowing water can be heard as well.  Perhaps it would be a
good place to rest.

Unlike the rest of the area around you, this area seems to be surprisingly
fertile, due no doubt to the stream of water running by it.  The crystal clear
water gently gurgles, providing vital nourishment for a few small trees which
have managed to survive here.  This seems a nice, peaceful place.

Pant, pant.  This hiking trail is certainly long enough!  The road you travel
is rather slippery, with small pebbles and dust underfoot.  Only with the
most diligent of efforts do you manage to keep your footing, and continue
to hike upwards.  As you continue walking upwards, you seem to see the
end of the trail close by.

to rest, before hiking those final few steps to the overlook northwards.

Finally!  You've reached the top of this climb, from where you can see the
surrounding lands.  Far north are the Esterian Highlands, a grassy, rather
undeveloped place.  Back south, you can see the Griffon and Sword Castle
in the Lowlands, and just barely make out Pinebluff and Emmeraux.  Off to
the side and downwards, a large encampment can be seen hazily through
the clouds.  The view is beautiful, but there is nowhere to go but down.

`8A Resting Zone ``~
A small niche has been carved out of the rock here, no doubt by a group
of travelers who had crossed this path as well in the past.  The room is
very small, and would barely fit in a small group of people.  It's very
stark and bare, and the stone isn't exactly the most comfortable of
materials to recline upon.  Still, for one who is exhausted after the mad
scramble up the sheer cliff, a resting zone like this is probably a Godsend.

The steps continue to the north, this time with blood stains of the captives
mixed in as well.  The dust no longer blows so freely here, with the red
liquid mixing in and forming a muddy cake of dirt, of sorts.  The ground
itself is littered with discarded items that the Raiders deemed useless.
Farther to the north, you seem to hear the sounds of celebrating raiders,
getting closer and closer.

`3Before a Minor Camp ``~
You are now very close to one of the Esterian Raider's minor camps.
Directly north of you, you can see a large group of raiders, laughing
at their conquests, prodding and poking their new steeds and livestock.
The present area has several large boulders, behind which you can
hide from their eyes.  Several lookouts can be seen, scouring the area.
There is no way to sneak by them.  It seems you'll have to fight your
way past.

The Raider encampment ahead of you seems to be guarded by a
tall watchtower, from whence several guards seem to be looking
down upon you.  They seem to be prepared for your arrival; no
doubt the Raider who escaped earlier had come here and
forewarned them.  Spilling out of the watchtower, they raise a
cry and hue, alerting the entire camp of your presence.

the Raider's keep their livestock.

are tired or fatigued.  Several of them lie sleeping right now,
snoring away loudly.  The area is very messy, with left over
food and bottles of stolen wine littering the area.

`8Center of the Camp ``~
You have entered the center of the Raider camp.  It is here that
Raider's come to rest and relax, boasting of their varied feats
of valor in the raids.  As they see you, however, all conversation
ceases, as they look at you uneasily, wondering how you managed
to get past the guards.  They seem unnerved enough that you just
might be able to walk past them without any trouble.

`8Amongst Prisoners ``~
So this is where all the moaning and groaning that you heard
was coming from.  Hidden in this room is a number of prisoners
captured from various raids, huddled together while being whipped
by a raider.  Laughing maniacally with each crack of the whip, he
turns, startled to see someone interrupting his fun.  Livid with rage,
he attacks.

`8Living Quarters ``~
This is the main room for the Raider's to sleep in when they
are fatigued.  Unlike the other two rooms, a large group of
raiders are here, laughing and talking to each other.  As you
intrude upon their sleeping halls, they immediately cease 
their conversation, and rush towards you en masse.

`3A Guardpost ``~
The Raider encampment south of you seems to be guarded by a
tall watchtower, from whence several guards seem to be looking
down upon you.  They seem to be prepared for your arrival; no
doubt a scout had come here and forewarned them.  Spilling
out of the watchtower, they raise a cry and hue, alerting the entire
camp of your presence.

`8Loot Warehouse ``~
Several large crates and boxes are stacked on top of each
other here, although unfortunately they are empty inside.  This
appears to be the private storeroom of the Raiders, used to 
temporarily hold goods that they garnered from their captured
caravans, as well as from their raiding parties.  Right now, though,
it's rather empty, with the booty having been moved to the main
camp northwards.

`3Past the Encampment ``~
The trail through the Raider Mountains continue, with the path
continuing northwards to the Highlands, or southwards, where
you can see a minor Raider outpost.  It seems to be guarded
by a watchtower.  If you want to get by, it seems you'll have to
fight your way through.

`3Trail Through the Gap ``~
The trail ahead of you snakes sinuously like a serpent, weaving
from up to down, left to right.  To the east and north there is a
small hill, through which the path runs.  Caravan tracks mark the
dry earth, headed eastwards, even more deeply within the Raider
Mountains.

`3Trail Through the Gap ``~
The path through the Gap continues, as the unforgiving sun beats
down upon you mercilessly.  Off to the side, you can see a few
starved rats of some sort chewing hungrily on the corpse of some
poor animal which has died here, from either the sun or of thirst.
They turn and look at you, ready to fight for their food if needed.

`3Trail Through the Gap ``~
The mountains loom down upon you from this point, almost as if
they are frowning down at you.  No living thing is in sight, and the
sun is unbearable, even though the mountain air itself is rather chill.
Although you are high up in the mountains, it feels almost as if you
are traversing a wide desert, with no end in sight.

`3Approaching Another Hill ``~
You are standing at the base of a particularly high hill, which
is covered with a strange sort of dry grass along it's entire side.
The ground here is cracked and broken, much like the grass which
it nourishes, and a hot wind blows across from the summit.

At the top of this hill, the scenery is much the same as from
the bottom.  A strange sort of dry grass still covers the entire
floor, although it seems to be somewhat even more yellow and
sickly than that in other places.  The wind blows across the flat,
featureless landscape, and there is nothing to hide behind.

`3A Narrow Trail ``~
This trail leads along the crest of the hill, dry grass crinkling
beneath your footsteps.  The wind picks up further here, whipping
across the hill.  The landscape within your vision is bland and
unremarkable, and there are no landmarks to make it of any more
significance.

and there are no landmarks to make it of any more significance.

`3A Gloomy Path ``~
As you leave the main path and venture this way, the sun slowly
begins to stop beating down on you so forcefully.  Here, there is
actually some trees and other forms of vegetation, which provide
some shelter from the blisteringly hot sun, as well as the glacially
chill wind.

`2A Darkening Path ``~
There's a great deal of shade here, as tall, leafy trees form the
beginnings of an impassable jungle.  Despite the relative comfort
compared to the rest of the Gap, however, for some reason, this area
gives off an aura of sadness and misery.  Flickering lights can be seen
out of the corner of your eye.  Indeed, this entire area resembles
nothing so much as a swamp...a haunted one.

`2A Small Cave ``~
All around you, the marshy land has grown deep and impenetrable.
The land is soft, and makes sucking sounds towards your feet.
There is nowhere to go from here except to a small cove, where
the ground is much firmer, and where you might rest for a time from
the swampy lands.  As you enter the cave, however, you notice that
there are a great deal of scratch marks on the floor...almost as if
stone had, many times in the past, grated on stone in a sliding motion.

`8A Short Tunnel ``~
A small, dimly let path through the darkness is here.  The tunnel
is cramped and small, and some strange form of moss glows on
the walls.  They give off a rather strange, pungent odor, as well,
reminiscent of some of the nastier forms of medication you have
taken in your life.

The ground here is solid, and a warm breeze blows through.
Have finally managed to leave the smelly damp tunnel, you
take a deep breath, and notice that the air here is fresh and
clear, unlike the rest of the chasm.  This place, unlike the rest
of the chasm, seems to be brimming with life.

watch towers guarded by some very unsavory looking characters.

encampment.
