Mission 1: Destroy the Dark Raiders near Goblin Village
 
  You are to find and eliminate a group of Dark Raiders in Miden'nir.  My

  Inn of some kind.  Find them, kill them, and report back.

  clothesline.  Travel south to Eastern Shanty Street, and then west to
  Southern Common.  From there head south across the Southern Drawbridge and

Mission 2: Destroy the Raider Leader in South Miden'nir
 
  You are to inflitrate and assassinate the Raider Leader in his HQ in 
  Miden'nir.  My contacts report that he surrounds himself with heavy
  guard within some sort of cave or tunnel in souther part of the forest.
 
  You might need to gather a group for this task, as the raiders are 
  fierce and in numbers.

Mission 3: Weaken the Goblin Village defenses.
 
  The idiotic Goblins have grown confident with the raider leader dead.
  They've been cutting down on their 'protection' payments.  You are to
  enter their village and take out the goblin scouts, and goblin guards.
  DO NOT in any way make your association with me known or you will have
  a Syndicate headhunter upon your head faster then you can say 'bounty'.
 
  From the Central Common, head west until you find yourself beneath the
  Western Ramparts.  From there, venture south, and then immediately east
  into Zalango's Stables.  Give Visram 100 gold, and mount your new yak.

Mission 4: Take care of the Goblin Council.
 
  The blasted goblins have gotten a scent of my plan!  They've 
  refused all payments and have made threats.  See to it that their
  shaman and chieftain does not make it through this night.  My spies
  tell me the shaman is paranoid and stays invisible at all times in
  some cave within the village, so use the magical dust from Elemental
  canyon I've provided.
  
  DON'T FAIL ME.
