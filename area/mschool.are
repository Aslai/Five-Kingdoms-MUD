The Headmistress~
The Headmistress stands here, watching over the students.
~
You see before you a very attractive woman, clad in white Adept robes. She
bears encircling her waist a long silver chain, denoting her Keeper status.
With long flowing golden hair, a porcelain face, and attractive green eyes
that you feel like you could easily get lost in, you understand that this
Keeper is perhaps the most important person on University Grounds, save for
the Headmaster himself, whom she reports progress directly to.

An adept of Markul is here, training younglings.
~
Encased in a shimmering sphere of light, the Adept who stands before
you is at one with his own holiness. Garbed in simple attire, an aura
of divine power radiates from him, causing your skin to tingle just as
you stand in the same room with him. It is perhaps best to train, and
go about your business. Tangling with these adepts may very well be
the last thing you do!

`8--==`` `&Forbidden Acts`` `8==--``
 
Please remember that this MUD is put here by the Immortals for you to enjoy.
They are not paid for their services here, and are here to encourage, support,
and, when needed, discipline. Their word is absolute, and talking back to,
insulting, or harassing any Immortal, or abusing any channel with 'spam' will
only get you banned. The following is a list of acts expressly forbidden by the
Staff of the Age of Mirlan:
 
1) `&Any advertisement for any other MUD or service.``
2) `&Spamming, excess profanity, or harassment.``
3) `&Disrespect to any staffmember.``
4) `&Any attempt to hack, solicit, extort, or infringe on any property of FL.``
5) `&Any other act deemed inappropriate by the Staff.``
~
E
chapter5~
`8--==`` `&Skills and Spells`` `8==--``
 
Based on your character creation, your character will have at his or her
disposal a large arsenal of skills and spells. To view all available spells
for your class, simply type 'spells', and likewise for a skill listing. For
more information on the function and correct syntax of each skill or spell,
simple type '`^HELP <SKILL OR SPELL>``'.

~
E
chapter3~
`8--==`` `&Your Character and Life`` `8==--``
 
All players here are required to have a description BEFORE rank 15. To write
a description, read up on '`^HELP DESCRIPTION``'. If you are unsure of what is to
be written in a description, '`#PRAY``' to an Immortal for assistance. You will
have a [`#D``] by your name until your description is approved by an Immortal.
With this approval comes a substantial experience and stat gain, so it is very
worth your while to get this done as soon as possible.
 
All characters begin life at age 17. Every four deaths, a character will
lose a 'Condition' or 'Con' point. Once your condition has deteriorated to
abysmal (generally around 60 deaths), your player will face a permanent death.
 
Keep in mind a history of your character at all times. Remember that roleplay
here is enforced, and is very well rewarded. Play well, and you will enjoy
yourself!

chapter2~
`8--==`` `&Channels and Conversation`` `8==--``
 
Channels on this MUD are a privilege that the Immortals grant the players. As
a newbie, you have access to 'Newbie Chat' (syntax: 'Newbie <message>'). You
may also 'SAY', 'PRAY' (A direct channel to the Immortals), 'EMOTE' (see HELP
SOCIALS), and 'YELL' (restricted to players level 2 or greater).
 
All of these channels, save for the NEWBIE channel, are ENFORCED ROLEPLAYING
channels. For more information, please see '`^HELP <CHANNEL>``'.
~
E
chapter1~
`8--==`` `&Basic Rules and Regulations`` `8==--``
 
There are several basic rules and regulations that a new player must adhere to
while within these realms. First, keep in mind that this is an ENFORCED roleplay
MUD. You are to remain IN CHARACTER at ALL TIMES, unless an Immortal expressly
gives you permission to go OOC. With the exception of the NEWBIE CHANNEL, (See
Chapter 2), all other channels within this MUD are ROLEPLAY ENFORCED. Keep in
mind that you may be being observed, even now.
 
This MUD allows NO MULTI-PLAY whatsoever. While you are free to have as many
characters as you wish, none are allowed to be logged in from the same address
at ANY time for ANY reason. This is HIGHLY enforced, and breaking this cardinal
rule WILL result in a ban of your character from this game. This law as well
extends to sharing of OOC (Out of Character) knowledge with friends via any
type of chatroom or messenger service.
 
For more information on these rules, read HELP RULES, HELP NEWBIE, and HELP
MULTI for any further clarification.

Welcome to the Training Quadrangle. To your east and west lie practice
rooms where Adepts of the Gods await you. Here, you will increase your
proficiencies at skills, and use your training sessions to increase your
attributes. Help files are available for all skills and spells, as well
as attributes. You get one train every five levels of rank, so be sure
to use your trains wisely! As well, 10 practice sessions can be converted
into one training session at your trainer, (located within each city).
You gain practice sessions each rank, and the amount you get is based
solely on your Wisdom. Once you have read this, `#SCAN`` in any direction
to see where the trainers are. You can also use `#SCAN ALL`` to scan in
all visible cardinal directions.

Ixtaros is the son of Morgorin and Veshalma and is the father of the Lords
of Strife.  Ixtaros is responsible for war in all its barbarous fury and
bloodletting, unlike Tiradels code of chivalry and honor.  Ixtare, the red
moon created by Sahaeyeh, was taken in battle by Ixtaros and now proclaims
his power to the heavens.
        
Temples to Ixtaros vary but many include means of viewing Ixtare 
at its fullness.  Nearly all the humanoid races worship Ixtaros as their 
patron deity, especially the more warlike ones, like gnolls and hobgoblins.

Human sacrifice is very common among such tribes. Clerics of Ixtaros are
expected to be in the thick of battle.

As a new traveler, you will find many nuances of life here interesting.
You will also notice that, as you travel, you will become affected by
hunger and thirst. It is a wise idea to keep with you at all times some
means of sustenance, as well as a water skin of sorts. Around Mirlan, many
cities have fountains, however, while traveling into the mountains or
forests, water and food become much less available. Your hunger and your
thirst will not cause any noticable damage or injury to you before you
attain level 10, however, it will affect your health and mana regeneration
rate, so it is best to keep well fed and quenched. You will find that you
can eat certain bodyparts of creatures that you kill (arms, and legs), but
other parts, such as guts, may be poisoned, so be cautious!

Gaemina is a primal god.  One of the original three.  She is the mother off all
Mirlan.  Her sphere is Nature, Life and Being.  While she does not usually have
many followers those that are her followers are generally of the Druid, Ranger
or Lycan's.  Those that do worship her never commune with her directly by more

statue~
Morgorin is the personification of all the evil in the world as well as being
the Lord of the Dead.  He is one of the four great deities of Mirlan, being the
brother of Beronor and half brother to Pajumet and Markul.  Morgorin is active
among mortals, sowing evil and discord among them, directly as well as
directing his numerous servants.  The followers of Beronor, Rasazra, and Tiradel
actively oppose many of his schemes yet his plots are everywhere.

The worship of Morgorin usually takes two forms.  For most people, he is a god
to be feared and placated, thus those not of evil alignment honor him in his
role as guardian of the dead.  Others serve him directly as the Evil One, hoping
for power and favor.  Ceremonies to Morgorin are held in underground temples,
oftentimes located within cities or their burial grounds.

Shadowspawn's hand is in nearly all aspects of Mirlan. It dabbles in 
each species, each guild, each cabal, whether the denizens know of 
it or not. He is the aberration of all that is evil, and the 
embodiment of pure Chaos. Those who have come before Shadowspawn have 
called him 'Crypticant', in the Old Tongue meaning 'Heart of Darkness'. 
It is said that utterance of Shadowspawn's name will bring about the 
Fifth Cataclysm. Rumor, perhaps. However, those who have come before 
Shadowspawn have been forever changed. Those who have lived, anyway.
To this day he breeds beings of Chaos, new Demons come forth every day 
from his hidden nexus and taint the planet with evil and pain. His 
friends are only pain, misery, grief, agony...This is all he knows, all 
he believes. To know of Shadowspawn is to know true terror and fear...To 
know Shadowspawn...is to know Death.

Mirlan is a very violent place. All around, wars are fought, and
people die following their causes. For now, as a youngling, you are
safe from the harm of other players. However, once you attain the
tenth rank, a <`1PK``> will appear by your name as well as the names
of other individuals who you can harm, and likewise, can harm you.
At level 10, you may attack and kill, and as well be killed. However,
not until the rank of 15 can you loot the corpses of fallen players.
Playerkilling (PK) ranges are highly balanced here in Mirlan, so
there is seldom the chance of an unfair kill. Be highly wary of
those who may wish to cause you harm, by using 'WHO PK' and 'WHERE
PK' after you reach the rank of 10.

statue~
Dormicc is one of the youngest gods and was not born in the usual manner, but
was created by Felana and Lojani to wander Mirlan and protect those who do
likewise.  Dormicc disdains cities and towns, instead preferring to roam the
wilderness aiding fellow travelers in need.

Because of this wanderlust, temples of the Wandering God are small and
located in wild areas away from civilization.  Few are staffed but all offer
hospitality for they are kept well stocked with food, water, and fuel for those
who require them.  It is not unusual to find clerics of Dormicc traveling with
those of Arondos.

Amathe~
Amathe is the wife of Beronor and the mother of the Gods of 
Weal.  It is she who is ever ready to offer healing and rest to her 
husband and children in their struggles against the Lords of Strife.  
Often she has healed the other gods as well, including the ones bent on 
causing harm.

Temples of Amathe are found in many areas and all are devoted to 
healing and helping the less fortunate.  Offerings given to the goddess 
are used to feed and clothe the poor.  Many of her clerics are pilgrims 
and travel the countryside, dispensing aid to all who need it.

Clerics of Amathe are the most revered of all their brethren for 
the works they do.  They must always seek to aid those in need, even (or 
especially) at their own expense.  They may fight if necessary but only in 
self defense.

Beronor~
Beronor, the Father, is the predominate deity of good and 
the father of many of the other Gods of Weal.  They strive against the 
plots of his brother, Morgorin, and that deitys lineage, known as the 
Lords of Strife.  Beronor and Morgorin are the highest order of deities 
short of the Primal Ones.

Temples built to honor Beronor vary in structure but all share a 
similar feature: a great golden dome topping the innermost sanctuary.  The 
domes are pierced in such a way as to allow the sun to shine into the 
temple on the solstices and equinoxes.  The motions of the sun are thought 
to reflect the gods struggle against his dark brother.

Clerics of Beronor are well known for their zeal in rooting out 
and destroying evil.

Where Ixtaros represents all the atrocities and horrors of war, Tiradel

with his sister Rasazra, and few are the orders that do not honor these gods.
Tiradel is active among his followers, guiding them on quests and holy
missions, often against his uncle Morgorin.

The sword is the holy symbol of Tiradel and all of his places of worship are
constructed to resemble one.  There are no particular days that are holy to
Tiradel; as his sphere is warfare and honor he is usually invoked before
appropriate occasions.

Rhuma~
Rhuma is the younger child of Sahaeyeh and Madshem and brother to Hoiwinas.
Like his father, Rhuma is concerned with the material aspects of life,
especially wealth and is a favored god within mercantile cities.  Although
Rhuma is true neutral, his clerics may be of any neutral alignment this is the
only deity where this is possible.

The worship of Rhuma is centered in his temples, which resemble great wagon
wheels.  The inner hub is the sanctuary and is topped with a great golden
spire.  A market is usually built in front of his temples, allowing the god to
see all that transpires.  Clerics of Rhuma are consummate traders and hagglers.

taking grim delight in its hardships.

There are few temples dedicated to this goddess as few choose to honor such

require her attention, mostly executions and torturers.

Pajumet is the one of the oldest gods and most powerful.  In ranking order
she is found with her brother Markul just below the Primal Ones, making her one
of the four strongest Greater Deities.  She has many worshippers, but is, as is
to be expected, a fickle goddess, and bestows luck on both sides capriciously.

Temples to Pajumet are usually located in cities or towns as opposed to the
lonely countryside.  Dedicated to randomness, her priests are as likely to
hinder as to help.

Chronology and Timeline

For the recording of time, there are currently five main systems 
in usage.  In the north, time is measured from the year that the Paylen 
and Esterian tribes were unified into the Kingdom of Paleganor  this is 
called Year of the Kings 1 (YK 1).  The Eastern Empire and its neighbors 
and some of its former territories reckon years using the Imperial Year 
(IY), which has its first year some 770 years after the first YK.  The 
southern kingdoms are much older and their time scale, Southern Year (SY) 
was brought with the immigration of the Tzambuli tribesmen, already 
counting the year 1313.  Both the dwarven (Muzaran Year  MY) and elven 
races keep separate calendars but these are little used by men.

Heralds are the lifelines of history in Mirlan. Often, they are the eyes
peering from the corner of a bar, watching the social elite and listening
in to the gossip and stories of the current and past events.  Interacting
with the various characters abroad, Heralds observe the very history of
Mirlan to link Mirlan to its notables.  They are loyal to the Winds, every
so often coming to meet with their superiors and giving them what 
biographies
they have recorded.
 
A Herald's communication skills are what he/she relies on.  Heralds
demonstrate through their intelligence and wit their story telling and
rumor gathering skills.  Heralds are also courteous to those deserving
of courtesy, given the number of people they must interact with on a
daily basis.  Those who flagrantly use foul language or violence have
no place within the cabal.
 
Anyone who wishes to may ask a Herald for the history of a certain person
of Mirlan, and the Herald will give them what knowledge he/she has.  When
a Herald does not do this, they are considered to be unessential, and may
be extricated from the group.  Also, if a Herald is remiss in his/her duty
to collect biographies, that Herald is also ousted from the group.  Bards
and Monks are the classes best suited to be Heralds, although non-physical
classes may also join if they meet cabal requirements and have exceptionally
good role-play.

Well done! You have the silver medallion of the Cloudman, now. Before you continue,
you need to learn about a few little things! First, a strange creature lies below
you, who you will have to face next! The `!WIMPY`` command will allow you to set
a number of hitpoints at which you will automatically flee. If you type "wimpy" with
no arguments, it will automatically set it at 25%, so you will flee a foe auto-
matically if your hit points drop below 25%.
 
Next, within these lands, you will fight many creatures! After they die, they will
leave behind their corpse. These corpses can be sacrificed to your Deity, in an
exchange for a few gold coins. To do this, just 'sac corpse'. As a newbie, you will
find that you automatically loot and sacrifice corpses. To toggle these, simply type
"`#AUTOLOOT``" or "`#AUTOSAC``".
 
Once you are finished, drop this medallion. The cloudman will not take kindly to
visitors leaving with his prize!

`8The Gateway into Mirlan``~
You have died. You have visited the regions beyond. And you have been
reincarnated yet again to walk among the realms of the living of these
people of Mirlan. A bright white light surrounds the room in which you now
stand. There are no walls, no floors. You float in nothing, merely a mass
of astral energy awaiting a body to overcome, and give life to. Below you
unfolds a world, and as time passes, it grows larger, giving you a full
observation of what lies below.  There is a twinge of regret as your old
past is washed clean, and you are reborn to live again in the realms of
Mirlan...

You stand before a set of colossal ivory gates. You are not entirely sure
how you got here exactly, but on a golden sign that adorns the top of the
gates, you can see the words, 'Training University",  'Established in the
Year of the King 121'. North, you can see a large path that leads into a
set of small rooms. If you have been here before, you can walk south and
enter the practice arena, or, if you wish to gain the knowledge and
instruction regarding the world in which you now live, continue north.

field, with small saplings and bushes planted haphazardly. It is quite large,
and very airy. Bloodstains lie here and there from fallen corpses in battle, and
a large masonblock wall surrounds the entire Courtyard. The sounds of clashing steel
can be heard over all else.

to be limited. Several large torches are stuck in the ground at various parts
of this massive Courtyard, lighting the Courtyard, even at night. The grass below you
is damp from the evening dew, and slippery, either with the same dew, or with
spilled blood.

`2The Northwestern Part of the Courtyard``~
You stand amid the Combat Courtyard. It is what appears to be a very large, grassy
field, with small saplings and bushes planted haphazardly. It is quite large,
and very airy. Bloodstains lie here and there from fallen corpses in battle, and
a large masonblock wall surrounds the entire Courtyard. The sounds of clashing steel
can be heard over all else.
~
You stand amid a darkened field. The night air is chilly, and visibility seems
to be limited. Several large torches are stuck in the ground at various parts
of this massive Courtyard, lighting the Courtyard, even at night. The grass below you
is damp from the evening dew, and slippery, either with the same dew, or with
spilled blood.

toward the square of the city, where you can hear the daily commotion of
citizens going about their daily tasks.

`8On a thick rope``~
You are hanging well above the courtyard, now, heading upward on a long, thin
rope. You feel it best not to tarry here, lest the your grip on the rope slip,
and you find yourself plummeting downward onto the hard ground. A small cloud
is floating above you. The rope seems to lead directly through it.

You find yourself floating on a small cloud, far above the Courtyard.
The surface here is odd, and almost spongy, and it is very obvious that
this cloud is magically created. Eastward, you see something glimmer in
the distance, and you feel a compelling need to venture there, to see
what mischief is afoot.

`8A cloudy archway``~
You stand an a strange, clouded archway. There don't seem to be any exits here,
at least none visible, but lost within these clouds, anywhere could be an exit.
The strange, airy room you are in is almost squarish, with some thick, glowing
carpets lying on the "floor", hovering slightly. The only way that appears to
be 'out' is back behind you, from whence you came. A large cloudman stands here,
casting a "stormy" gaze at you as you enter.

my cloud structure here, and frighten the birds...Only one word will answer the
riddle, and keep the birds from fleeing...Think on it...

`8Lost in the clouds``~
You cannot see so much as your hand before you face in this area. As you
find yourself clawing for vision, you feel the claws of some beast attack
you immediately! In the confusion, all perspective of direction is lost,
and you feel the need to `!FLEE``!

`8A cluttered study``~
You stand within a cluttered study and bedroom. Large bookshelves hold massive
tomes of forgotten knowledge, while several small desks hold candles that have
long since burned to their base. The floor is covered with wax and discarded
sheets of paper, and a small bed lies unmade in the far corner. Downward lies
the classroom.

`8A spartan bedroom``~
You stand in a room above the classroom. The room is rather bare, but sports
a wooden bed, and a few leather sacks filled with clothing and training weapons.
A small desk sits in the corner, where several sheets of parchment lie with
haphazard abandon about the desk. A small flight of steps leads downward to
the classroom.

say You will find many useful enchantments at your fingertips.
