Two glaring eyes stalks you from the shadows.
~
A dark shadow materializes before your eyes.  These mist-like creatures 
have a hatred against all living beings.  The sole purpose of their 
existence is to drain the life force of others.  Yet, it is strange that 
they do not attack until aggravated.  They could only survive in 
darkness, it is best to leave before it notices you.

Shubak~
An old man huddles by the campfire here, muttering to himself.
~
Witha long, coarse grey beard and his wrinked, tan skin this appears to
be a very old man.  He stands shorter than the average human, accentuated by
the slight hunch in his back.  One lazy eye stares off into the distance as
the other wavers about your general direction.  His fingernails are dirty
and his stubby fingers are covered in soot.  A simple loincloth is the only
covering he has, and a skimpy one at that.

`3Path to the Lesser Raiderss``~
You see a mountain range to the north.  The higher up the mountain, the 
steeper it gets.  Sharp, ragged rocks line the crest, making it impossible 
to reach the top safely.  You stand amongst loose rocks and pebbles that
have fallen off during recent landslides.  A stone paved slope takes you 
directly to the base of the mountains.  The ground is a little muddy due
to the pool just south of here.  As you get near the mountain, the wind
begins to pick up a bit.

`3Base of the Lesser Raiderss``~
You stand at the base of a steep mountain range.  Dark ominous clouds loom
overhead in a menacing way.  Large boulders are parted to the side, 
clearing a path that allows you a passage into the mountains.  You spot 
some vultures circling overhead, waiting to descend to a meal of an 
unfortunate traveler.  A sign to your left warns hikers to not stray off 
the trail, perhaps you should heed it.

`3Beginning of the Rocky Slope``~
A soft slope stretches toward the mountain peaks, inclining steeper 
steadily.  Most of the rocks have already slid to the base of the 
mountain, leaving less debris blocking the way.  Small bushes grow in 
clumps, sheltering some animals from the piercing wind.  You notice a path 
to your west, long covered by dirt and rubble.  You can barely make out
the faint outlines of the trail, which leads you around the mountain along
it's base.  There is another trail leading north, which would take you
straight toward the mountain peaks.  You can also choose to leave the
mountains right now if you don't have the guts.

no visible signs indicating where the trail will lead you.  Footsteps 
cover the trails, both used recently.  There is a hiking trail to your 
north that many have used, trying to reach the mountain top.  Or you can 
go east, a much easier path that would take you around the mountain, but 
would probably take longer.  A dead tree stump stands between the two 
trails.  What's it gonna be?  North, east, or back down?

You stand on a dirt trail alongside the mountain.  On one side the 
mountain continues up, too steep to climb up.  On the other side, the land
drops from beneath your feet, too steep to climb down without falling.  
You can peer over into the base of the mountain from here. There are many
plant life present, ranging from large pines to small bushes.  All sorts 
of animals run about.  They do not seem frightened by your presence. 
Instead, they run up to you and hope for some food.  The trail runs from 
east to west, leaving you with little choice where to go. You also
notice a small path leading to the north.

to feel uneasy as you become aware that eyes are staring at you from 
behind the trees.  Hoping that they will not bother you, you quicken your 
footsteps and hurry along.  You can either go either north or west.

campfire had been set up in the middle of the clearing.  All that's left 
in it are ashes and some bone remains.  Two logs have been pulled up to 
the campfire to be used as chairs.  Now fungus cover the logs, and the 
wood decays away.  The campsite is next to a flowing river to the west.
Judging from the rapid movement of the water, there might be a waterfall
nearby.  At the edge of the campsite, the trail runs down and to the east.

The pines stands more than fifty feet tall and points toward the heaven

Large boulders have fallen from above, and collected down here.  The rocks
pile up in such a way that you can jump from one to the other, using them
as stairs.  The boulders are loosely fit in space, so you should watch
your step if you decide to climb up.  They might come loose at any second,
causing another landslide.  Few shrubs grow between the cracks in the
large boulders.  Most of the green you see are a special breed of moss
that
only grows in these parts.  You can climb up the boulders to the top, or 
you can follow the trail south.

so it is mostly barren with only some insects and spiders.  The trees

woods.  Buried under some rocks, you find another trail leading off to the
east, continuing the path around the mountain.  Or you can choose to
tumble off the landslide, curled in a ball.

No more than three people can stand side-by-side on this steep trail.  You
have to take careful steps or you might lose your footing and fall into 
the ravine below.  You peer down but can only see darkness.  You notice
that the number of trees decrease as the slope nears the bottom.  You
remember that down this trail leads to what the others call the 'Grey
Death.'  You can follow this trail down, or you can climb out the other
direction.

`3Entrance to the Barrows``~
Now you know why they call this place the 'Scarlet Death.'  Thousands of dead
trees decorate the landscape, not a single living one in sight.  The bark
of the dead trees are deformed, and bare a deathly grey texture.  Their 
branches are twisted and gnarled, snaking toward you as if they're alive.
This place is littered with bones and rotted armor.  There is a deathly
aura as far as the eye can see.
  Close to fifty years ago, this is where the final confrontation was
raged during the Great War between the orcs and the elves.  The blood of
the orcs was so poisonous, that it killed all the trees it contaminated, 
leading to the scene you see now.  The barrow continues to the north, or
you can take the trail leading up out of the barrows.

vultures dare to venture in this dead land.  They circle above you, as if

You stand right in the center of the mountain range.  The mountains have 
formed a circle around you, isolating you off from the rest of the world. 
The wind starts to pick up a bit.  Strange.  You wonder why the wind
wasn't blocked by the mountain ranges.  The wind feels unnatural, as it
bites your face.  There is a strange howling caused by the wind blowing
through the dead hollow trees.  It almost sound like voices crying out for
help.  While trying not to let the voices bother you, you can make out a
path continuing into the valley to the west.  Going up takes you out of

behind the trees.  Hoping that they will not bother you, you quicken your
footsteps and hurry along.  You can either go either north or west.

if you're not careful.  Most of the vegetation here are ferns and pines.
The pines stands more than fifty feet tall and points toward the heaven
itself.  The trail runs north and south.

`3An Abandoned Outlook``~
Two spy towers stand alone in this clearing.  It was built during the 
Great War that occurred ten years ago.  The towers were built on this
high-point to keep posted on the enemies' advancement.  A pile of ashes
within a circle of rocks indicate that it was once a campfire.  Several
human bones protrude from the ashes, along with other animal remains.
This outlook probably belonged to the Orcs deep inside the mountains.  The
towers have been abandoned long since the end of the war.  Little animals
now take refuge in the crudely built huts, since no one use it anymore.
The slopes are too steep to continue further up the mountain.  The only
way left is back down the mountain.

the moon.  It was built during the Great War that occurred ten years ago.
The towers were built on this high-point to keep posted on the enemies'
advancement.  A pile of ashes within a circle of rocks indicate that it
was once a campfire.  Several unidentified objects protrude from the.  
This outlook probably belonged to the Orcs deep inside the mountains.  The
towers have been abandoned long since the end of the war.  Little animals
now take refuge in the crudely built huts, since no one use it anymore.
The slopes are too steep to continue further up the mountain.  The only
way left is back down the mountain.

`3A Forgotten Trail``~
This used to be a shortcut to the City of Leominter before the Great War.
It was widely used at the time.  Now that the city has been destroyed, and
no one has rebuilt it, this path has been forgotten by everyone.  The
trail is covered by weeds and dust.  The trail continues along the base of
the mountain to your west.  East takes you to the mountain slopes.

This trail lies hidden in the mountains.  It has been unused since the
Great War fifty years ago.  No one travels up this part of the mountain
anymore, unless they want an adventure.  Other than following the trail,
there is nowhere else to go.  The trail leads to the east.  You can see

`3A Craggy Overlook``~
You find yourself overlooking a vast mountain valley. Around you, the
craggy peaks of the Lesser Raider mountains crest, and remain donned
in white snowy caps nearly year round. Within this small clearing that
rests only slightly below treeline amid stunted trees and bushes, a
small campfire circle has been made, which smokes merrily. The chill
wind of the mountains seems to whistle through the canyons and spires
around you, but seems to strangely keep this clearing safe from the
treacherous mountain weather.

you from the shadows, monitoring your every move.  The trail continues to

Above you, carved into the very moutainside, is a large gate that shines

into the moutain Temple of Light. The only other way off this place is
down.

Alas, you have reached the once great elven city.  This is only thing that
is left standing, the rest of the city is in ruins.  It was pillaged by 
the orc hordes fifty years ago during the Great War.  It was the struggle
between good and evil, and evil prevailed.  The elves were driven back,
after losing the final war right before the valley of wind.  The elves
retreated further west, now known as the valley of the elves.  The horde
no longer exists, their headquarters is now a major city inside the
mountain to the west.  The entrance is deep down the valley of wind.  West
takes you toward the ruins.

of the city.  The trail of destruction continues to the east.
