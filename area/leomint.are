Paulie pawn shopkeeper Assassin~
Paulie the Shopkeeper~
Paulie the shopkeeper waits to do "business" with you.
~
Dark, brown eyes meet yours without hesitation. His features are rough, and
accented by his thick brown hair.  You can almost feel the tension running
through his body, beneath his well-hemmed, expensive, and very fashionable
clothing.  A gilded scabbard hangs at his side, with a large and ornate hilt
protruding from it.  A curious sigil is embossed upon the scabbard, a mark
which is repeated on the door behind him.  Something in the way he talks
suggests that he knows more than he lets on.

Lands, the city remains an empty wasteland.

`7The South Road``~
You are on the South Road of Leominter.  It is gloomy and dim here.  All
around you are beggars and panhandlers dressed in filthy clothing.  The
buildings surrounding you are old and run down.  They seem like they have
been made ages ago.  The once bright red bricks that the buildings are 
made of are now only pale, brittle chunks barely holding the walls of the
buildings together.  You see a dark alley continue to the north and the
south, and the South Road continues to the east and the west.

`7Entrance of the Cleric Guild``~
You are standing before a small and plain gate.  The gate is worn out and
the hinges creak from not having been used for a long time.  Vines cover
the gate, wrapping the gate thoroughly so that no part of the granite that
made up the gate is shown.  A sign hung here above the gate but is no
longer comprehendible due to the aging of weather.  From the style of the
gate and its plain design, this must be where the guild of the
once-popular clerics resides!

`2Entrance of the Ranger Guild``~
You are at the beginnings of a glade in the middle of the park.  There 
are no trees here to block any of the light shining down from the sky.  
The wide-open field is carpeted with short green grass, bearing a 
comfortable habitat for many minute life forms.  The dirt under the 
grass is soft, seemingly to have never been stepped on.  You see the 
open glade in the east and tall trees to the west.

`2Ranger Glade``~
You are in the middle of a wide-open field.  There are some bows and 
arrows that are stacked neatly on a rack in the middle of the field.  
Off in the distance, there are large targets for which a ranger can 
train and practice his shot.  There are also axes lined up against the 
rack to familiarize the rangers with the art of axe throwing.  The short 
grass on the ground challenges the rangers of their ability to 
camouflage against the forest background.  You notice a hidden camp to 
the south and the edge of the glade is to the west.

brown tents lined with green leaf lie in a circular formation in-between 
the trees of the glade, perfectly camouflaged with the forestry 
surrounding it.  A small pile of ashes outlined by hard white rocks lie 
in the middle of the circular formation, giving off a thin stream of 
smoke.  You see an open glade of the forest clearing to the north.

`4On a Calm River``~
You are on a calm river inside Leominter.  The cool waters of the river
flows smoothly along between the river banks to the sides.  Small pieces
of drift wood flows by you at times.  The aroma of the algae and the
various tiny life forms inside the river taints the once-fresh smell of 
the water.  The river extends to the east and the west.

A small bridge connecting the Main Street of Leominter spans over your
head. The bridge casts a shadow over this part of the river.  A set of 
posts on each bank of the river help support the bridge over your head.  
Small pieces of drift wood flows by you at times.  The aroma of the 
algae and the various tiny life forms inside the river taints the once-
fresh smell of the water.  The river extends to the east and the west.

You are standing before the gates to the Healer guild. The gates are 
pure and white glowing with the goodness that pours from within. The
faded symbol of glowing hands hangs next to the gate telling passerbys
of the miracles that take place inside.  The gate leads north to the
guildhall of the Healer Guild and the North road is to the south.

You are in the guildhall of the Healer Guild. There are all sorts
of medicines, bandages, and other supplies that help in the healing
of those that deserve it. The walls are plain only covered with shelves
that hold the supplies. The shuffling of feet by those that are tending
to the sick fill the air with noise. To the west is the Infirmary and to
the south is the Entrance to the Healer Guild.

`8The Infirmary``~
Surrounded by a room completely polished in white, your soul is 
overwhelmed by a sense of peace.  As physicians tend to the sick, nurses 
remove bandages from newly healed wounds.   Surprised looks follow the 
healers as the patients flex once broken bones or wounds that have 
miraculously disappeared.

Before you lie the gates to the Shaman Guild. They have long since
fallen off of the black granite that once held them. A small sign is
hanging by a single nail on the post. It has the ancient lord of death
encrusted upon it face. Smells from the guildhall to the north fill your
senses with disgust. The temple of darkness is to your east.

covered in slime and mold. The floor is slippery beneath your feet.
In the corner of the room there is a hole that leads to the Chamber of
Rituals. To the south is the entrance of the Shaman Guild.

as someone inquires about curing type supplications.

Dust blows and wind howls through the cracked walls of this building.  To

`8Entrance to Mockers Tavern``~
Owned and controlled by the Guild of Bards, Mockers Tavern is by far 
the most popular place to be when the sun goes down.  There is always 
a small group of people hovering about the entrance like flies on a 
corpse.  The tavern, from the outside, seems dull with no vivid colors 
or images, just a schedule of performers hanging close to a small 
wooden door.  Gentle music softly emanates from the semi-opened door 
along with mirthful laughter and general happiness.  Going north leads 
you to the King's Sceptre Inn.  To the east in Mockers Tavern.

`8The Lounge in Mockers Tavern``~
Seated around the performing bards and minstrels are their enchanted 
guests.  Some eat on wooden tables as they listen to the weavers of 
tales.  Others sit on wooden stools conversing with friends.  The 
atmosphere of the room is completely dependent on the performer, and 
the mood she wishes to convey.  A soft lighting also sets the ambiance 
in the room.  To the west to the door exiting Mockers Tavern and 
heading south leads to the backstage.

`8Backstage of Mockers Tavern``~
A controlled chaos best describes this scene.  A potpourri of notes 
and melodies saturate the air as everyone sings and practices all at 
once.  Dances and skits are being rehearsed for upcoming shows.  Bards 
from across Mirlan share their songs and adventurers with all not too 
busy to listen.  The walls are filled with paintings of famous bards.
Beautiful mandolins, harps, and strange instruments hang on the walls 
as trophies and prizes.  Further back into the room is a quieter 
section where a single man sits, obviously amused by the happenings 
going on in front of him.
