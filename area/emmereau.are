wears a constant smile upon his face and often times his mirth and good

the Guildmaster of the Miners~
The Guildmaster of the Miners reclines here with a pipe.
~
Fat and jolly with a massive white beard, this long retired miner
seems to take joy in teaching young miners the arts of rock hunting.
He is dressed comfortably in a plaid shirt with leather pants and
a set of worn out leather boots. A strange hat rests cockeyed on his
slightly balding head.

Koiher, the Master of Thaumaturgist Guild stands here in thought.
~
The man seen before you is old beyond compare, yet it is still hard to
put an exact age to him.  Vibrant crystal eyes burn with an inner light of
one possessed, electic in the quality and unnerving in their brightness.  He
stands tall, for age has not yet bent his bones, nor do you expect it to in
your lifetime.

This vision of loveliness radiates pure beauty with her warm greeting
smile and twinkling eyes.  Her full lips and sharp features mark her as a
half breed human-elf with much of the elven features over powering the human
ones.  She is thin and dainty but the look in her eyes holds a danger not
many are willing to ignite.

His unshaven face is streaked with sweat and grime, and his black,
beady little eyes are set far back in his head. A cauliflower nose
juts out protuberantly, while thick, meaty fingers toy with a heavy
chain filled with keys that hangs from his ratty belt.

Lillian, the Tavern Wench, is here, serving drinks.
~
This busty broad is the ideal candidate for the Maiden and the Sword.
Indeed, she may even be the 'maiden' in question, though she looks anything
but chaste and virtuous. She is human, for certain, with long black tresses
braided on either side, trailing down to her elbows. Her proud nose only
seems to accentuate her birdlike face with rosy, cherub cheeks, and the crow's
feet around her bright, twinkling blue eyes show a life of happiness, but
hard work. She is clad in a white blouse, cut low as to reveal her generous
bosom, with a light blue silk petticoat trailing from her waist to the floor.
A leather apron adorns the front of the petticoat.

You are looking at one of the finest robes you may have ever seen.  It is
made out of some kind of material that seems to be smoother than silk and
lighter than air.  Its blackness is blacker than the night and the gray trim
seems to glisten silver.  At the center of this marvelous robe is a gray
skull embroidered with what looks to be actual silver threading.  Some
strange symbols also accompany this symbol, that seem to translate in your
mind without your understanding.

leads north and south, through Emmereaux. Because of the fog, rain, 
and generally damp conditions, Rhuma seems to be in a perpetual 
state of muddiness, and such clings to nearly everything around you. 
To your immediate south lies a training area.

`8The Temple of Tiradel ``~
You stand within a rising, cross-shaped hall that has exits on
all four sides. The southernmost portion of the hall extends a
bit further, giving you the impression of a sword. Indeed, above
you etched into the rafters are the relief sculptures of several
swords, crosses, and mounted above them, a myriad of stone carvings
resembling weather-worn griffons. In several alcoves around the
room are mounted raiments of combat, including helms and mail.

You stand within a large cross-shaped room with symmetrical
risers that ascend to support a massive copper dome roughtly
fifty feet overhead. The stone rafters are open to the outside
air and are decorated heavily with geometric designs which are
picked out in relief along them. Several Tarquin birds can be
seen perched on the rafters overhead of this cross-shaped
edifice.

`8The Temple of Rhuma ``~
You stand in the very center of a structure that closely
resembles a wheel-like structure. Well over fifty feet overhead
a large spire juts skyward, shining in the light from several
small bird windows opened inside it. Exits lead in all of the
cardinal directions from this hub of sanctuary outward toward
the commercial districts of the city.

present along Rhuma Road. A man stands in the center of the field,
looking quite like the weather worn soldier he most certainly is.
A narrow alleyway runs off to your east and west.

is set into the ground here, and bears a large embossed skull
on the front, which has been painted silver. Remnants of melted
wax candles lie scattered about the yard. In each direction save
west, a narrow, weeded path leads into various sections of the
city.

`8Atop the Lighthouse ``~
You are at the top of the lighthouse.  The view is beautiful most of the
time when the fog burns off from the morning sun.  Nearly as tall as the
guard towers, this building is not near as old.  A huge steel forged cage
with sliders sits dead center of the room upon a circular track which is
turned but the large attached wooden handle wheel.

You are in a very intensely lit room.  The bright light seems to be coming
from the center of the room and is near impossible to look at directly.

You are in the store and home of Saxon the merchant.  As you can see by
the clutter that he does most of his selling on the fly.  A straw bed and a
cloths peg that sticks out of the western wall are all the real signs that
this place is even used as a home.

This is the upper level of Juberts forge and mercantile.  The place is
rather warm due to the heat generated from a days work in the forges below. 
The room is in some disarray as Jubert works most of the time and does not
seem to care to clean much.  The floor needs to be sweep, the whole place
needs to be dusted down and there is a moldy and musty smell that seems to
emanate from the old wood that this house is made of.

`1The Dungeon of Emmereaux ``~
You stand within the dark, dank confines of the Emmereaux dungeon.
Large, heavy stone walls line the room around you, and from the heavy
overbearing scent of earth, you can tell you are somewhere underground.
Rows of benches line the walls, and just above, large shackles hang
from inset rivets in the wall. Many are filled with remains; bones,
clothing, and even bits of skin and tissue hang from the old, rusty
chains. This is a very bleak setting indeed.

like to see angry, for anyone of such a size and disposition could do

`$The Serpentine River ``~
The murky bluish green waters move swiftly by in this massive river
threatening to take boats and those that dare enter these deep river waters
under to a watery tomb.

The rushing waters of the Serpentine have stirred up mud from the bottom
of the river bed which turns this area of the river a nasty brownish color
difficult to look too deeply into the depths.

`$The Serpentine River ``~
The river becomes a bit more shallow here as you can see the smooth river
rocks that have settled on the bottom of the river.  Still running too swift
to swim its current remains a driving and deadly force of thousands of
gallons of water.

In the middle of this fast paced rivers currents someone has erected a
shrine to the goddess Lojani.  This beautiful figure of a statue is poised
with her urns with what looks like her pouring water into the river which
give the illusion that she is actually creating the Serpentine River via her
Urn.

As the river widens here the current appears to slow some.  Experienced
sailors will note that the current does not become less dangerous but more. 
The undercurrent of this vast expanse can be seen by the eddies on the
banks and the near reverse look of the flow of water.  Tide pools quickly
engulf all floating objects here.

named the Serpentine with all the turns and twists.  Like its namesake the

`8The Northern Gate of Emmereaux ``~
You are before the massive Northern Gate of Emmereaux. Often just
referred to as "lordsgate", this marks the main defensive bastion
of Emmereaux, and is definitely the largest gate in the city. It
can easily hold four horse drawn carriages abreast, with room to
move. Dozens of guards patroll these gates, checking the endless
stream of travelers who enter and leave the gates for any would-
be criminals or outlaws. Camden Avenue runs east from here, while
to the west, the gates turn into Chevalier road.

east, Camden Avenue begins, while westward lies the main northern

`8Seawall Road ``~
You stand along Seawall Road, the southernmost point of Emmereaux.
Named for the massive stone seawall that rises just to the south
of you, obscuring your view of the Sea of Palinor, Seawall Road has
been carefully designed to keep rising tides and bad weather from
flooding Emmereaux. It is very foggy here, and the sound of crashing
waves fills your ears.

`8Beneath the Southern Watchtower ``~
Much like its sister tower this one is built very solidly.  Thicker than
most of the other Emmereaux towers yet not as tall.  To the west you can see
that the road continues on for quite a distance along the sea wall.

`8The Intersection of Seawall and Beacon Point ``~
You stand at the intersection of Seawall Road and Beacon Point. The
theme of the road changes significantly here, switching from gray
cobblestones to a sheer white pavement, looking much like ivory.
Each stone is inlaid with the insignia of a golden sword beneath 
a golden crown. Northward, you can see a massive structure rise up, 
while Seawall Road continues east and west.

`8The Intersection of Seawall and Rhuma ``~
You stand at the intersection of Seawall Road and Rhuma Road. The
condition of Rhuma Road, despite its connotations, is fairly poor.
The road is packed earth, and the yellowish soil seems to be in an
ever-present mud state, caking itself onto anything that moves through
it. Rhuma leads northward to a training area, while Seawall continues
east and west.

`8Chevalier Road ``~
You are walking along Chevalier Road. Once just a service road for
the Emmereaux Army, it is now open to the public for travel beneath
the city's several watchtowers. It winds and zigzags its way from
the northern gate all the way to the west gate. The road below you
is well worn hard packed earth. Eastward lies one of the two northern
watchtower of Emmereaux, while the road winds south.

`8Beneath the Northern Watchtower ``~
You stand beneath one of two of the northern watchtowers that peer
over the massive North Gate. Rising over a hundred spans above the
street level, they are manned all hours of the day by the local city
guards, who keep vigilant watch over their beloved Emmereaux. To the
west, Chevalier road begins, while eastward lies the main northern
gate of Emmereaux, or "lordsgate".

As the river widens here the current appears to slow some.  Experienced
sailors will note that the current does not become less dangerous but more. 
The undercurrent of this vast expanse can be seen by the eddies on the
banks and the near reverse look of the flow of water.  Tide pools quickly
engulf all floating objects here.

The Imperial Road dwindles to a path here, then finally little more
than a faded trail as it disappears westward into thickets, and ultimately
the Yarlwood. Just south of you, the Chill and Serpentine rivers unite,
and run westward until they drain into the Venpal Ocean. Here among
the lands of Palinor, you feel very alone, as rolling hills of this
tundra are all you can make out for miles.

than thought. The Imperial Road leads West and East. West to Yarlwood and
east to The Palinese Checkpoint.

The grass on either side of the Imperial Road shines a healthy green. 
Untainted, this grass surely would be beneficial to any animal who wishes
for a meal.  The combination of the road and grass seem to intensify the
beauty of this land.  Only good can come of traveling West revealing more of
the path.  There is a small turn in the road before continuing West.

Coming to the end of east travel, there are a few turns in sight from this point.
They are small turns, forcing you to adventure Southeast. The brush is knee high at
this point, luckily, it only grows on the outside of the path. The brush does not
affect your travel much. But because of the healthy soil to the side, you can spot
a few insects crawling around in the pattern of the stone path.

`8Beacon Point Road ``~
You stand amid Beacon Point Road. Beneath your feet lies a sheer 
white pavement, looking much like ivory. Inlaid on each stone is 
the insignia of a golden sword beneath a golden crown. Directly to
your east looms the massive Palace of Emmereaux, home to the Monarchy
of Emmereaux. Massive white stone gates block much of your view,
as throngs of guards keep close watch over the front gate.

to lead into some sort of a training area, while south of you the
massive seawall of Emmereaux looms.

`8The Entrance to Emmereaux Palace ``~
You have just stepped upon flag stoned marble that has been culled to
form a solid walkway that leads to the palace up ahead.  The sides of the
walkway are trimmed out with exotic plant life that seems to be in perpetual
bloom.  Reds.  Blues, purples all radiantly show off their petals.  The
greens of the bushes are a deep wide leaf type.  There is a arbor just
before the entrance of the palace that has some yellow jasmine growing up on
it.

You are walking along the Emmereaux Beaches. This strip of sand
leads north and south along the coastline of Palinor, home of the
city of Emmereaux. Eastward, the shallows of the Sea of Palinor
are roiled and choppy, whipped up by the chilly wind that seems
to always be present in Emmereaux. Westward lies a small set of
stairs the leads back to Seawall Road.

locals as Sinners Tower.  This watch tower over the years has become a haven
for those that are seeking a little "privacy" to come to and get away from
it all.  Most of the time this place is fairly empty.  While the guards use
it as a base station, they do not usually man it heavily.  Sometimes not at
all as the guards stationed here are those that walk the city and keep the
city safe from rift-raft.

were the masons have patched them over with new stone work.  It looks as
though they have been preparing this tower for some other purpose and by the
looks of the holes in the floor, newly placed metal work, perhaps a new
dungeon is being built here.  

Strangely enough it looks at though this room has recently been used as an
altar room.

The drip of water can be heard in the distance. To your east, a
