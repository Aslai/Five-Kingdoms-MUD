The Platinum Dragon~
The Platinum Dragon known as Haan, ally and friend of the Duke, sleeps here.
~
The mighty Haan served as the Duke's steed during the Goblin Wars many
centuries ago, but is now way past his prime, and he spends most of his
time sleeping and dreaming of past glories. For, long-lived as Wyrms are,
Elves are much longer-lived, being virtually immortal, and it saddens both
Haan and his master that their days together are now numbered.

`3The Plains of Grayldemir``~
You have emerged from the elven valley on the plains of the Elven Duchy
of Grayldemir, ruled by the good Duke Stalatharata, under the guidance and
watchful presence of his God and Mentor, the Elven Cleric Arondos. Tall 
spires rise in the distance, emerging from the magnificent Elven city of 
Grayldemir, to which the path you are upon leads.
There is a small, hand-lettered sign near the path...

`3The Road to Grayldemir``~
You are moving along a broad, well-formed path that is bordered by neatly-
groomed trees and hedges. To the north you can hear what sounds like a horse
braying, while to the east the city of Grayldemir looms larger.

You feel a sudden sense of peace and serenity wash over you as you enter this
gentle wooded glade. Here the sound of braying is louder, and you fancy you
can smell the odour of equine beasts. The aura of the surroundings make you
feel like doing nothing more that lying down and resting for a LONG time...

`2The Unicorn Glade``~
You have entered the sanctum of the Unicorns of of Grayldemir, close friends
and allies of the Elves of Grayldemir. However, despite their benevolent
nature, the Unicorns dislike intruders, especially armed and aggressive ones,
and will not hesitate to use extreme force to evict these intruders. In
addition, to protect these creatures, the Elven sorceror Tuo has placed
powerful enchantments on this place that prevent magical attacks on the
unicorns.

`3The Road to Grayldemir``~
You have progressed further along the road to the Elven capital, past several
farmhouses and various creatures of the wild that stop to stare inquisitively
at you as you pass. The gates of the city are now visible, as are the guards
stationed near them, their colorful rainments dazzling you even from this
distance. In the near distance there appears to be a monument of some sort.

`3A Monument to the Elven Lords``~
At this point on the road the Nobles of Grayldemir have had a huge marble 
monument erected, dedicated to the many Elven Lords who died during the 
ferocious Goblin Wars that devastated most of the Elven Nations. The statue 
shows a band of Elves courageously defending an unarmed woman and her child 
from a band of hideous Goblins, and is quite brilliantly fashioned. There is
an inscription at the base of the statue.

far more distinguished and well-kept than its neighbours. A pungent herbal
aroma wafts on the wind to your nose, and your eyes water involuntarily.

quickly accustomed to the vile smell you detected earlier, and even find it
to be rather pleasant. Mithara quickly informs you that the substance is 
tobacco, and that she specializes in it. She also has a wide range of other
substances, including potions, herbs and healing salves.

constantly on guard for troublemakers or looters. However, the City of
Grayldemir is always open to peaceful travellers, and it has not been necessary
to close the City Gates for six decades.

 the fullest extent of the Law.

`8Base of a Tower``~
You are standing at the base of a guard tower, near the Gates of Grayldemir.
You may proceed west to the Gates, or east towards a second tower, or enter
the tower you stand beneath. You fancy you can hear a faint screeching 
coming from this tower...

There is a hand-written note pinned to a noticeboard nearby.

It is here that the young Elves who wish to become Elite Scouts live and
learn. They are rarely here during most of the year, often out hunting,
tracking or fighting Goblin raiders. The few that are here are those that
were not fit or worthy enough to take to the field this season.

co-ordinate their efforts to keep the peace in the streets of Grayldemir,
handling mostly cases of petty crime (the Elite Guard handle serious 
problems). They frown on civilians entering their premises, but will
tolerate your presence for they will recognize you as a mere ignorant
foreigner who probably doesn't speak enough Elvish to understand when
they're being told to LEAVE.

rings, swords- every manner of object possible. A brazier in the center of  
rooms holds some burning herbs, which fill the room with an acrid smoke. An
elderly elf is busy fiddling with a rather strange contraption upon which he
places black plastic discs from which a rather odd sound emerges, along with
much scratching and hissing. He has quite a collection of these disks, which
are packaged in luridly-colored paper envelopes, replete with pictures of
rather weedy-looking, long-haired, pale-skinned humans (?).

stands here, awaiting you.

`8Invoker Guild``~
The room you have entered has been beautifully rendered by some Elven
artist to resemble a peacefuly woodland setting, complete with
masterfully-painted images of Sylvan creatures.  Amidst all of this towers
your Guildmaster, extremely tall, and quite imposing clad in his concealing
flowing brown robes.

`8Ranger Guild``~
You stand amid a pleasant room, filled with flowering green plants of all
types of flora.  The room is airy, and fresh, and the floor below you is
made of hard packed earth.  Your guildmistress stands here idly trimming
flowers, while she waits for you to speak to her.

`8Healer Guild``~
Totally white this room is flawless.  In the centre is a warm spa
presumably to bathe away any aches and pains.  You immediately feel relieved
of all your stress and burden.  Aelian looks at you kindly offering training
and comfort.

`8Thief Guild``~
You have entered a dimly-lit study which has little in the way of decor,
save for a very well crafted image of the body, with tiny labels attached to
each segment.  A rather scrawny looking man garbed in dark clothing stands
here, and greets you as you enter.

The Sign Says-
 "To the Prospective Student-
  Type PRAC to see what skills you are able to learn here. If nothing comes
  up, I am unable to help you and you must leave.
  If any skills in the list interest you, then type PRAC <skillname> and I
  will impart what knowledge I can to you, free of financial cost, though
  this will obviously expend some of your practice points.
  Once you are done, you may leave, hoepfully a little more skilled.
  BTW- Do NOT forget that there are significant experience point penalties
  for practicing skills that are not native to your race.

  Signed,
	Your Guild Manager.

`8The Guild of the Battlemages``~
You stand within the Hall of the Battlemages.  Large practice dummies lie
strewn about here, covered in scorched marks, and most with severed limbs
and heads.  The air smells of brimstone, and you can see that the heavy
cement walls have deep scoremarks caused by stray blades from other
students.

`8The Captain's Quarters``~
You have entered a well-furnished office which serves as the reception area
for the Captain of the Guard. He will chat with you here about your concerns
and try to give you advice, but will always remain on guard. He boasts to 
you of the fact that his office is a magical field, and that dimensional 
gateways occasionally appear here. Sounds like crap but you never know...

`8Sun Room``~
You have entered the Palace's Sun Room, famous for his huge crystalline
windows specially crafted to capture and magnify the rays of the sun so that
the room is brilliantly lit at all hours of the day. A few easychairs and
cushions have been scattered across the floor here, and you see a couple of
Elven Nobles languidly relaxing in the warmth of the sun, sipping on fine
Elven wines.

about the doorway, casting the occasional suspicious glance in your 
direction. Massive stone statues of past Elven lords tower above you on all
sides.

here are cunningly designed to capture and reflet moonlight so that even
on the darkest nights there is illumination. Nobles lounge around here, idly
singing old tunes or playing simple games of chance.

South Door, in honor of some half-forgotten festival.

`8The Duchy``~
It is here that the Duke and his wife receive their subjects, seated upon
huge platinum thrones flanked by their Elite Guards. Occasionally Tuo the
Arch Mage or Lallinthenera the High Priest will attend, though both dislike
such officious business. Your footsteps echo about this pillared hall as
you tread slowly upon the marble floor. You can feel several pairs of eyes
on you as you travel, and suddenly find yourself eager to be gone from the
room as soon as possible.

`8The Water Room``~
The second you enter this room you begin to panic, as you suddenly think you
are far underwater! But you quickly compose yourself (trying to ignore the
amused stares cast in your direction), and realize that the room you are in
is in fact formed of sheets of glass behind which flows sea water complete 
with several species of marine life. The effect is unnerving, but quite 
beautiful. You have to concentrate hard to cross the room, and can't help 
but imagine you are truly walking on water...

of the Archmage. Several scouts mill about, their Ridgeback pets left 
momentarily unattended, and you suddenly feel very much an alien in this
place.

Wait...No you aren't. Unbelieveable as it is, the entire room has been
fashioned so as to appear to be open sky, with no walls, floors or celings.
People wander about, quite unfazed by the effect, and you feel a little
foolish as you clamber to your feet and attempt to get your bearings.

many books being constantly borrowed, returned, bought and sold. You are
overawed by the sheer volume of books in this place, and gasp as you realize
that the shevles are at least seventy feet high and extend as far as you can
see...

You stand before a large marble structure, devoted to the Elven God,
Arondos, the patron God of Grayldemir. Though many claim there never
was a God named Arondos, the Elves of this city don't seem to care. The
structure rises over a hundred feet, and is intricately carved with the
famous Elven murals of battle.

and you see little that seems interesting. You are not surprised no-one
wants any books from this area.

Alternatively, you could just return to the ground floor...

emanates from splintered fragments in the wall.  Here and there little dried
up blood stains, no doubt from accidents with wandering dancing blades, give
the impression of clumsiness.

drapes, that give the room a muted sound. Large torchiers light the
room well from each corner. In the center of the room stands a rather
large altar, with several books placed open there. The smell of rich
incense fills your nose.
