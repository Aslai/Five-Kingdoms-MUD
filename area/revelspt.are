He has been hired to sit watch and guard against those that may tresspass.
Patience is his virtue for in time, his blade will surely sink into your
unarmored hide.

corpse~
You see a mangled, bloody corpse resting here. The skin is tight and
drawn around once beautiful elfin features. Torn strips of flesh lay
draped off the body of the corpse, where he was obviously whipped to
death, only recently. He lies here naked, and bloody, and a dark power
prohibits any being from getting to near the body, much less picking
it up. It seems to have been placed here as a warning to Knights, by
the dark, demonic forces, for a large pentacle has been branded on the
chest of the corpse, and two fingers have been removed from each hand.

large inverted cross. Two fingers have again been removed from each

corpse.

My Dear Zenja,
     It has been ages since we've spoken. So much time has
passed. I have found myself stranded in the ruined town of
Revelsport. I am well, and my faith in Drenaar has grown
much stronger from my solitude. 
      But not a day has passed that I have not thought about
you, your sweet smile, your kind heart.
      The bearer of this message has traveled long and far to
see that it is delivered to you. I am sure you will treat them
accordingly.
     Know that I miss and love you.
 
Always,
      Lorien

yet complete. Flies buzz around his once youthful features, and his face
is a mask of pain and agony. Large steel nails inscribed with an inverted
cross are nailed into his hands and feet, and dried blood runs down his
arms. He is nearly naked, save for a dirty white sheet covering his waist.
A large inverted cross has been burned into his forehead, and it is now
black with age. The crucifix seems to be protected from removal by some
dark force.

`7The Southern Square of Revelsport``~
You stand in the Southern Square of Revelsport.  This area was a rallying
point for the Survivors in the Horde of Flames invasion where the heros
of the Age of Darkness turned the Horde's troops away, and
defeated the last front of the Chaos Demons.  Lord Welty Street runs to the
east and west, into a darker and seedier district of Revelsport.  A large
shimmering statue rests in the center of the square.

statue~
A large cobalt statue of Athaekeetha is erected here. It is
weather worn and eroded, and thought to be Revelsport's oldest
relic. It is well cared for and guarded, however, and shows
the God facing south, as if warning off invaders.

piled up to the ceiling in each corner, and candles burn unchecked

you are kept immaculate records and files, as well as myriad books

in many of the arcane arts, and lend to their profession knowledge
on all the other magics in Mirlan, besides simple battlefield magic.

guild of the Medici, the Healers of Mirlan, hangs from two small
metal posts, and swings in the light breeze. This is where the
sick of Revelsport go to be cured of their ailments, and receive
the blessings of the Gods of the Light.

desk, and she looks at you quizzlically. You feel a bit dizzy,
and are overcome with a sense of deja vu'. Where have you seen

Once a fortress of the sadist vigo, times have changed.  The beautiful
Fayette has used her magic to create a hanging gardens and fountain
emporium.  Silver streams trickle down the sparkling granite walls and end
in small golden pools where tiny fish swim at incredible speeds.  The smell
of cinnamon and nectar fills your senses, and you feel calm.  By day a meat
cutter, a feeder of the poor.  By night a flowering magician and disciple of
creation.  The sparkling walls give the impression of sunlight streaming in
this magical abode.  As you bend to drink from the enticing pools, they
dissapear.

to a large, dark forest. North is the second rampart of the
city, and the southern district. Guards are posted everywhere
here to keep lookout.

`7Before the Main Gates of Revelsport``~
You are at the final rampart of Revelsport. There is light
traffic here, and the guards keep a close watch on all who
enter and leave this way. Years ago the worst of Mirlan's
foes entered Revelsport from the south, and the keepers of
Revelsport have been wary ever since.

intricate scenes of daily life in the city.  A large brass bell hangs from
the center of the central chamber, next to which hangs a large steel mallet.
