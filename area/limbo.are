A Chaosdemon stands here.
~
Before you stands a demonic aberration, stemmed directly from the ethereal
nexus. This is unlike a Chaos Demon, who lives in these planes. This demoic
minion lives only to kill and rend flesh, and seems much less sentient than
his Chaotic counterparts. Large claws to tear skin and huge, twisted muscles
are set in its body to snap bone. Fear grips you as you look into its eyeless
face, and it flicks its long, serpentine black tongue at you.

A small, cute kitten with stripes purrs here.
~
Soft and furry, a pink-nosed kitten glances innocently about with big, 
golden eyes, its tail sticking into the air with the tip slightly bent to 
the side.  Yellow and orange stripes coat its body from nose to tail to 
ever-so-delicate paws that are supported by supple, pink pads.
He looks far too intelligent to be your average cat.  As you look closer
into his eyes you find that there is some other spiritual force driving
this cat to another.  Other than that he is a cute kitty, who likes
warm milk and lots and lots of kitty snacks.

Grey skin is stretched tightly over a man-sized frame.  This odd
creature's head is devoid of feature, a blank sheet of flesh composing it's
face.  Thin arms are pulled to the side of it's body as thick iron chains,
covered in runes, bind it to the sides of the cage.  As you gaze at it, it
makes no movement or action to otherwise signal sentience.  How is this
creature a threat?  None can know.

an elven valykre~
An elven Valkyre stand here waiting for you to look at her.
~
A tall, lean elven lady stands before you, clad in a heavy suit of
brilliant gleaming armor kept in top condition.  Her arm, decorated on the
forearm with a silver blazing torch, tightly graps a gigantic mithril
polearm with an enchanted silvery blade that you can see your reflection in.
She has a lean, nimble figure as do most elves, her muscles are noticeably
larger and more definded than those of her fellow elves.  

Her face is simply beautiful, as if god had spent a great amount of time
perfecting every feature of it.  Her light tan skin complexion perfeclty
agrees with her light golden hair and deep blue eyes.  Her face is
practically perfect, without any unsightly scars or blemishes detract from
her appearance.  What is most captivating about her face though, is her
eyes.  Her large, dark blue irises are filled with a look of curiosity mixed
with intelligence, and seem full of vigor.  Her facial expression is calm
and contemplative, yet displays a sense of confidence.  Her body is relaxed,
and legs positioned in a natural fighting stance that would allow her to
move with the speed needed to fight and defend herself effectively.  Her
confidence and superior physical condition suggest she is indeed a heavily
trained veteran of the battlefield.

Psalm of  Righteousness.

Following is a long and involved holy scripture about the Order of 
Crusades divine right to carry forth its missions, and its origins.  
various bits of  high minded propaganda are intertwined with very
advanced combat techniques that would give any well trained warrior
edge in combat.  You gather that this psalm will not only increase the
sheer damage the warrior causes, but also allow keen aim and precision.

Following is a long and involved holy scripture about the virtues of
meditation and benefits of clear and focused mind on resisting effects
of various spells and maladies.  Throughout the long psalm are woven 
techniques and chants that could easily be found in a secret manual
of a monk monastery.  It is obvious that when properly used the psalm
would bring great mental strength to the user.

Within are inscribed strange glyphs and runes that seem to portray
the effect of such meditation to further enhance the senses of a
person, and to better allow them to see with more clear sight and
vision than ever before. Intertwined within the glyphs are two
recurring runes, one for observing the moral traits of people, and
one for finding truth within what is ordinarily invisible.

God upon the nonbelievers.

A tall marble obelisk rises from the ground here, its surface showing 
signs of  years of erosion. At its midpoint surrounded by runes  of  
preservation a following inscription has been etched in delicate writing.
 
Psalm of Undeniable Order.
 
A glyph showing a devout one lavished in rare and unique adornments, this
psalm has three major runes: The vengeance rune, the mission rune, and the 
capital rune, denoting removal of the foe's head. The glyphs further show 
one under the influence of the psalm laying waste to the corrupt and damned, 
and in turn receiving incredible power from doing so.
  
A huge sigil of the Order of Crusades has been stamped at the bottom.

Psalm of Inner Strength.
 
The fist rune, showing in conjunction with the sword rune depict one
of the virtuous ones gripping a weapon of immense power with both hands
as his arms and body surge with inner strength. The negatory run is also
evident here, proving that this psalm cannot be used in conjuction with
others.

You are in a empty underground vault of solid earthen material without
exits.  Stalagmites and stalactites run the chamber all through out.  The
sound of relentless dripping of condensation falls from the heights above. 
An eerie electric bluish light emits from veins of magical material within
the walls and flooring.  Twisting and turning like some sort of marbleized
energy.  Lore has it that these veins are the very essence of magic captured
within this vault, deep beneath some unknown world.

other various chick flicks.  In the bathroom is a small wicker basket with

The floor here is covered with a black shaggy carpet, it has been well
vacuumed and sprinkled with a most pleasant fragrance.  Several couches are
in this room, they all appear extremely comfortable.  All around the room,
women with varying amounts of clothing are loitering, waiting for your
request.  A few of the couches already have occupants, receiving some very
sensual lap dances and....  Other things.  In the far back of the room there
is a small cocktail bar.  The topless bartender eyes you, waiting for your
order.  Also in the back of the room there are a few private booths, with
thick drapes, blanketing them in mystery.  From the various moans and
squeals, you can only guess what is going on behind Door Number One.  You
feel welcomed in this place, you begin to think of what it would be like to
have five minutes alone with one of the beautiful, busy women.

`2Before a Mirror``~
`&READ ALL WHAT FOLLOWS:``
 
  You have been placed here because your description ("help description")
did not meet with approval of the Immortal that moved you here.  Before
you are able to play once again, you will have to compose a better one
keeping following rules in mind:
 
1)  `!YOUR DESCRIPTION SHOULD BE FORMATTED TO AT MOST 70 LETTERS PER LINE.``
Use word processor to write/format/spell check your description, then paste
it into the mud's description editor. ("help editor")
 
2)  `&Your description should be like a picture frozen in time.``
There should be no actions being performed, only descriptions of what
the character looks like, or looks like he is doing.
 
3)  `&You should NEVER force the looker to do, feel or think anything.``
The looker should make up their own minds about who you are, and what
you might be doing.
 
4)  `&The description should describe you, not your history.``
Concentrate on describing your characters stance, face, body, and their
equipment.  Not who they are, and where they came from.
 
5)  `&Do NOT say how powerful, fearful, or deadly you are.``
The description is not the place to "stroke your ego" by saying how
powerful you are and how fearful you look.  
 
6)  You may include descriptions of equipment that you would like your
character to wear (family crested shields, particular sword etc.) since
it is understood that the actual game equipment changes too often.
When you are done your description and it has been `!formatted`` and 
`!spell checked`` pray ONCE per approximately 10 minutes that you are 
done.

From Shadowspawn,
 
If you see this room then it most likely means you did something we don't
approve of.  Word of advice, instead of giving bullshit excuses
or trying to talk back to the imms, shut up, listen, and most importantly
agree.  Because if you choose to ignore our warnings, don't expect to go
too far.

`8Slow, painful death``~
Yes, you have been sentenced to death. The Gods have found your actions
punishable by death, and so you sit in a fiery inferno, devoid of any
exit, to await your last mortal breath. If you believe you have been
wrongfully sent here to die, now would be a nice time to write the Gods
a scribe, and plead your case. But, chances are, you'll be dead long
 they before they read it. If you want a quick death, just say 'Death',
and the Executioner will see to it.

Dungeon~
a Dungeon~
Cries of agony reach yours ears from within a Dungeon.~
Not much can be seen of it, as the heart of this structure is always
built far below the ground.  Only the fortified entrance can be spotted, its
massive wrought gates worked with motives of twisted and tortured faces.

Palace~
Black Palace~
A Palace built of completely black stone dominates the area.~
Built of completely black stone, this Palace is as beautiful as it is
defendable.  Gargoyles snarl at you from the tall parapets bristling with
both weapons and the watchful eyes of the Zalango Admiralty.

Spawns~
a pack of Spawns~
A pack of twisted Spawns of Nexus slither about.~
Quivering and changing without pause, these misshapen forms are composed
of brown-green flesh corrupted by the forces of Nexus.  Eyes filled with
hate and unquenchabed anger lock with yours as a legion of voices hurls
threats and promises of damnation aimed at no one in particular.

Demons~
a Demon Horde~
A horde of Demons hovers overhead, their talons dripping blood.~
Soaring above on giant, leathery wings these demons pay no heed to your
presence.  Their large forms cast shapeless shadows all around, reminding
everyone here of their restless passage.  But what is most disturbing is the
utter silence that one does not normally expect from a force bent on
destruction.

Altar~
an Unholy Altar~
An Altar of Nexus has been raised here.~
Unnatural shadows dance around the massive Altar, its surface stained
with the blood of countless sacrifices.  The air about it shimmers with
power, occasionally taking on a blue or red tint as alien sounds pierce the
air.

Gateway~
the Nexus Gateway~
A Nexus Gateway crackles with hellish heat and unholy magics.~
Sending occasional arcs of black energies towards the heavens this tall,
flaming gate has but one purpose: to support the infernal spells of
Pandemonium conjurers.  The added benefit of keeping the portals between
Mirlan and Nexus open for demon and hell-spawn armies completes the
threatening nature of this Gateway.

Phantoms~
a group of Phantoms~
Winking in and out of existence a group of Phantoms is here.~
Their translucent forms shimmer in and out of existence as the roughly
humanoid shapes float above the ground with effortless ease.  Not a single
sound comes forth from the strange beings, their silent demeanor ominous
and unsettling.

Elemental~
the Time Elemental~
Sizzling fragments of time form a blurred translucent entity.~
The very fabric of time here seems strained to the limit as strange,
unexplainable energies dive and sizzle into the land below this entity.  Its
size seems at once enormous and small, far and close, its passage all but
unseen except for the ripples left in this reality.

the Mana Sphere~
The Mana Sphere floats far above, humming with weird energies.~
There is not much to see, but rather to sense as your mind instinctively
detects the enormous forces above you.  Once in a long while the transparent
outline of a giant sphere winks into existence as arcs of sparking energy
strike the ground.

The Time Vortex plays with the reality far above you.~
Your gaze towards the Vortex is as if looking into a distance, your
instinct telling you that it's infinitely greater than it seems.  Strange
ripples thwart your vision, their source the large whirlpool of power from
which howls the energies beyond mortal imagining.

A company of Blademasters stand ready for battle.~
A company of vicious swordsmen stand in loose formation, awaiting orders.
Their armors are varied but all wear signs of many battles.  Only one thing
relates them to each other: the particular look one has when one has seen
death many times and bested it.

Clad in fantastic armors and weapons they proudly bear the trophies of
past victories.  Their faces are grim, but their eyes sparkle as the
promises of battle and spilt blood ring in their minds.

A Fort flying the banners of Warmaster watches over the area.~
It is a sturdy fort constructed in a hurry but with great experience. 
The pallisade of sharpened logs provide good defense and a few squat
watchtowers have been built for advanced warning.

An army Staging Camp has been built here.~
A huge camp made of many tents surrounded by latched logs stands in the
immediate area.  There is a single, tall tower flying the banner of
Warmaster from which sentries watch the surrounding land.  An enormous
wooden gate stands in the centre of the massive wall allowing access for
those who are loyal.

A group of Elven Longbowmen hides in the area.~
Only the occasional creak of a bow or the rustle of cloaks betrays their
presence.  Silent and flawless in their deadly accuracy these bowmen are
masters of camouflage and, most importantly, ambush.

A unit of Warders hides in the area.~
Though you can barely spot them, the faint whispers of blades being drawn
and the occasional song of a non-existence bird betray their deadly
presence.  Their exact numbers are, however, uncountable to your eyes.

A massive Forest Glyph has been raised here.~
Its surface crawling with druidic runes this giant glyph emanates an aura
of peace and tranquility.  But the amount of charred corpses about its
perimeter and the perpetual boil of dark clouds above indicates that its
purposes are far from peaceful.

Rising far above the ground a mighty obelisk of earth and stone shoots
towards the sky.  Its surface covered by druidic runes, the area about it
shimmers with magical power.  It would be foolish to cross any follower of
Watcher within the protective aura of this mighty Obelisk.
