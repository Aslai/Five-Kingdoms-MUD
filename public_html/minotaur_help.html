MINOTAUR MINOTAURS
<BR>
<BR>Minotaurs are a race of demi-humans.  These fantastic creations of nature look
<BR>very much like large humans with bulls heads.  They are large creatures,
<BR>normally reaching upwards of eight feet.  These massive beasts are extremely
<BR>powerful but they do lack the wisdom, intelligence and greater dexterities of
<BR>the other races.
<BR>
<BR>They more than make up for these apparent weaknesses by their strength and
<BR>tenacity.  Minotaurs are extremely quick to anger and are very foul tempered.
<BR>They can appear to be very cruel but in reality it is their nature to not care
<BR>one way or the other how they are perceived by the other races.  They are
<BR>jealous to a fault of their mates and of their race.  Many a man found his head
<BR>on the ground after a minotaur felt slighted.  Minotaurs are great wielders of
<BR>the axe.
<BR>
<BR>A weapon that will generally be found to be used almost exclusively by minotaur
<BR>guards.  They have absolutely no fear of anything or any one.  Something that
<BR>tends to get them into situations they sometimes cannot fight their way out of.  
<BR>
<BR>Minotaur culture is run by the strong.  The mentality of these limited societies
<BR>is that of the ill, infirmed and weak have no business taking up valuable
<BR>resources that could be used by the strong.  A sick minotaur is counting his or
<BR>her last days.  This fact does not seem to bother most minotaurs as they do not
<BR>fear death but embrace it as a part of their psychological makeup.  Death in
<BR>battle is looked upon as a glorious thing.
<BR>
<BR>Minotaurs tend to have problems controlling their tempers but this has given
<BR>them an edge in battle as they have become very good at beign berserkers.
<BR>
<BR>Minotaurs can use their great horns in battle as if it were an extra arm and
<BR>they use this charging very effectively when ramming an opponent.
