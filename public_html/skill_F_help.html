<BR>Faerie fire is an offensive spell.  It surrounds the victim with a pink 
<BR>aura which prevents him from concealing himself in anyway.  Also, it 
<BR>worsens the victim's armor class, making him easier to hit as well as taking 
<BR>more damage when hit.  Note that faerie's own magical properties negate
<BR>this spell making it useless against that race.

<BR>
<BR>These spells creates a magical shield of the specific element surrounding the

<BR>opponents.  If an opponent is in combat with the thaumaturgist, there is a
<BR>chance that the shield surrounding the thaumaturgist will wound their opponent.  
<BR>Also, the shield acts as a dampening or an enhancement device against natural
<BR>elements.  Fire attacks against an thaumaturgist while he has surrounded
<BR>himself with a fire shield will enhance the attack whereas ice attacks will be
<BR>dampened and be decreased in power.  The basic thaumaturgist spells of Flame
<BR>Arrow and Icicle can be further enhanced in power by the shield of their

<A NAME="fired weapons"></A><BR></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#c0c0c0">
FIRED WEAPONS
<BR>
<BR>Some classes choose to focus and excel in use of ranged weapons such as bows,
<BR>crossbows, and other kinds of ranged weapons.  While almost anyone in the lands
<BR>is capable of using such things, only those specially trained have the skills
<BR>necessary to quickly aim, reload and fire such weapons effectively in heat of
<BR>combat.
<BR>
<BR>THE THEORY
<BR>When a projectile is fired, in general the chance for it to hit the target is
<BR>in large part dependant on the skill of the user, and the quality of the
<BR>launcher (bow, crossbow etc) being used expressed in its hitroll, with the
<BR>hitroll of the projectile playing a smaller part.
<BR>
<BR>The damage caused by the hitting projectile is dependant on its average damage
<BR>and damage dice, and is greatly enhanced by any kind of damage roll bonuses on
<BR>the launcher.
<BR>
<BR>Finally, the ability to use the launcher properly is very much affected by its
<BR>rank compared to your characters, at times severely limiting your ability to
<BR>use fired weapons which are lot higher in rank then you.
<BR>
<BR>Hence in general, the hitting ability is very dependant on the launcher and
<BR>skill, while the damage is dependant on both the projectile and the launcher.
<BR>
<BR>THE PROPERTIES
<BR>
<BR>Every ranged weapon has number of properties a marksman should be aware off. 
<BR>
<BR>- Ammunition:   The ammunition type the weapon supports can be general
<BR>		(arrows, bolts, arrows AND bolts etc.) or a specific
<BR>		item that is required for it to function (fire gems).
<BR>
<BR>- Capacity:	How many projectiles can the weapon be reloaded with
<BR>		at a time.  This can range from one to as many as twenty.
<BR>
<BR>- Shots/Round:	This specifies how many projectiles are discharged per
<BR>		use of the weapon with 'shoot' command.  The fired 
<BR>		projectiles are taken out of the 'capacity' number until
<BR>		none are left.  Note that non-limited projectiles are
<BR>		"used up" on firing, while rare or unique can be collected
<BR>		after firing.
<BR>
<BR>- Other:	Some weapons have other properties that grant them particular
<BR>		powers or uses.
