UNDEAD
<BR>
<BR>The undead are really not a race of and in themselves.  Undead are created by
<BR>other undead or the dread lords of strife as a reward for their evilness.  A
<BR>person does not start out as an undead but more to the point they aspire to
<BR>join the ranks of the undead for the powers conveyed upon such a
<BR>transformation.  
<BR>
<BR>There are many forms of undead but all generally conform to the same general
<BR>traits.  Holy word is poison to them.  It can send them running.  Items of good
<BR>and relics of good are the bane of the undead as well. With these apparent
<BR>weaknesses it makes one wonder why indeed one would aspire to join the ranks
<BR>of the walking dead.
<BR>
<BR>The undead are virtually immune to many forms of attacks such as disease and
<BR>poison.  As they are already dead they do not sustain much harm from these
<BR>forms of attack.
<BR>
<BR>They are powerful though in their own right and in their own way the undead are
<BR>much to be feared.  
<BR>
<BR>While the undead are a prolific problem, not much is really understood about them
<BR>as when one gets to close, they usually are in no place to ask questions of them.
