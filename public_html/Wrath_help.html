WRATH
<BR>
<BR>Syntax: commune 'wrath' (target)
<BR>
<BR>Paladins have the ability to call upon the gods of light to strike down the foes
<BR>of the caster with divine wrath.  This wrath is most effective against those who
<BR>walk in darkness and less effective against those who do not have a firm moral
<BR>commitment.  One should notice that this potent prayer quickly loses its power
<BR>against those seriously hurt or near death.
