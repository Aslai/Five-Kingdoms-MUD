ENFORCER
<BR>
<BR>A law without means to enforce it is worth less then the parchment upon
<BR>which it was written.  And so the Enforcers of LAW travel the land to
<BR>make sure that those whom have crossed the Laws within the areas patrolled
<BR>by LAW do not escape its iron grasp.  Capable of commanding ferocious
<BR>hounds and using variety of skills and powers to track and incapacitate the
<BR>criminals, the Enforcer is most at home outside the cities of Mirlan and
<BR>hot on the trail of a wanted criminal.
