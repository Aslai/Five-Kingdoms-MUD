UPPERCUT
<BR>
<BR>Syntax: Uppercut
<BR>
<BR>Another skill taken straight from the bars, a Bard has the ability to 
<BR>throw such a stunning uppercut that it can knock the jaw of the victim loose.
<BR>While the jaw is loose, no words can be spoken, nor can spells be chanted.

UNHOLY STRENGTH
<BR>
<BR>Syntax: cast 'unholy strength'
<BR>        cast 'unholy strength' amplify
<BR>
<BR>Before the rise of guilds in Mirlan, the Eternal Army ruled the lands by
<BR>combining rigorous physical and magical training with a strong central
<BR>leadership that drew from the combined powers of all its members. The unholy
<BR>strength spell is a vestige of that era, before the coming of Light shattered
<BR>the army. It allows dark-knights to draw from their own life-force to strengthen
<BR>themselves physically for a short time. A mana upkeep is requires to sustain
<BR>this state of heightened power.
<BR>
<BR>Casting unholy strength when one is already under its affect increases the power
<BR>of the spell. However, this will also increase its upkeep.  The spell's physical
<BR>limit is determined by the level of the caster.  One can also amplify the effect
<BR>of the spell to make it last longer, but the upkeep will be correspondingly
<BR>increased as well.
<BR>
<BR>At the end of the unholy strength, or when the dark-knight cannot support its
<BR>upkeep, the caster will feel drained from the effects of the spell. Note that it
<BR>is much more dangerous to enter this state from failing the upkeep than when the
<BR>spell expires naturally.
