TELEPORT

<BR>Syntax: cast 'teleport'
<BR>Syntax: commune 'teleport'
<BR>
<BR>The teleport spell randomly takes the caster from his current location to
<BR>another location somewhere else in the realm provided his is not in combat.
<BR>This spell is very useful to get away from those who are chasing the caster.
<BR>However, it does not guarantee the caster safety.  The caster may end up in a
<BR>worse predicament then he was.  While the user of this spell has a better
<BR>chance to avoid unpleasant encounters with increase in skill, the random
<BR>nature of this magic makes no assurances.

TRAPS
<BR>
<BR>  Due to thieves natural willingness to lend their services to anyone with
<BR>enough gold, the land of Mirlan is riddled with various traps ranging from the
<BR>harmless to the deadly in their construction and placement.
<BR>
<BR> A trap may be present on any object, path or door leading from or to a room
<BR>and when spotted is represented by the symbol <font color=#FF0000>+</font> appearing beside an object
<BR>or exit.  An exit can further be looked at by using the "examine" or "look"
<BR>commands.
<BR>
<BR>  The chances to spot a trap before setting it off are decided by your wisdom,
<BR>and more reliably, the proficiency in the Detect Hidden skill. Thieves being 
<BR>quite used to these devices get a bonus towards detection.
<BR>
<BR> Any object or exit may be checked for traps and defused if one is found.
<BR>This is accomplished by using the "defuse" command.  If successful the trap
<BR>will be disarmed and destroyed if it was created by another player.
<BR>
<BR>  Most of the traps in Mirlan are created by the Thieves Guild and are maintained
<BR>by them.  Those traps cannot be removed, and will re-arm and re-set periodically.
<BR>
<BR> The traps set and created by freelance thieves/players once disarmed or
<BR>tripped are usually removed.  Traps also obey the PK ranges and cannot be
<BR>seen, defused or tripped by those outside of their owner's PK range.
