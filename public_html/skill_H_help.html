<BR>The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient.  Due to the
<BR>effect, it is known that the affected person may sometimes gain an extra attack
<BR>in combat, and gain a heightened ability in evading his opponent's attacks.
<BR>However, it produces a great strain on the system, such that recuperative
<BR>abilities are greatly hindered.
<BR>
<BR>The slow spell decreases the speed and agility of the recipient.  While affected
<BR>by the spell, the victim often loses his ability to attack as rapidly as he
<BR>normally can.  The victim is also hindered in evading his opponent's attacks.
<BR>However, the spell has a calming effect on the victim which allows him to heal
<BR>more rapidly, both physically and mentally.

<BR>would still need to take some time looking for a hiding place.  Sneak may be
<BR>used when moving (including to sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of
<BR>success.  It is very tiring to move great distances while sneaking.  Thieves
<BR>may learn how to hide and sneak.
