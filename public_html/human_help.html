HUMAN HUMANS ESTERI PAYLEN WUNGAR WYNNYC TZAMBULI
<BR>
<BR>  The human states of Western Realms are composed of pure strains and mixtures
<BR>of five distinct ancient races.  Of these, three are native to this region
<BR>(the Paylens, Wungari, and Wynnics) while the other two, the Tzambuli and the
<BR>Esterians, migrated into the central regions of Darengal from the south and
<BR>north, respectively. 
<BR>
<BR>Esteri (ess-TAIR-ree):  The Esterians are a tall people of an olive to tan skin
<BR>tone.  Their hair is black to brown, while eye colors vary from green to hazel.
<BR>The only region in the Western Realms that shows a pure strain of Esterian is
<BR>the Venpal Islands off the western coast of Palinor but many pure blooded
<BR>Esterians still dwell in the northern country beyond the Raider Mountains.
<BR>
<BR>The Esterian people migrated from the northern wastes of Darengal, far beyond
<BR>the Greater Raider Mountains that form the northern border of the Western
<BR>Realms.  Raiders and seamen by nature, they raided into the civilized
<BR>countries south of them and finally settled portions of the northwest and
<BR>central coastal regions, near the present day lands of Palinor and Restolynd.
<BR>The Kingdom of Palinor is an admixture of Paylens and Esterians in about a
<BR>50:50 proportion.  Esterian blood comprises about a third of the Restolynd
<BR>populace and roughly 15% of the Punts show some Esterian features.  The
<BR>Esterians are extremely skilled sailors and seamen and ships from the regions
<BR>populated by them are of exceptional quality and strength. 
<BR>
<BR>Paylen (PAY-lehn):  The Paylish are a stout people, shorter than the average
<BR>human.  Their skin is fair to tan and their hair runs from honey blonde to red,
<BR>and is usually quite curly.  Blue and green eyes are dominate with small
<BR>amounts of brown or hazel.
<BR>
<BR>Paylens were native to the Serpentine River Valley in central and southern
<BR>Palinor.  With the coming of the Esterians, the Paylens were gradually either
<BR>assimilated into the conquering Esterians or pushed eastwards over the Lesser
<BR>Raider Mountains.  The only areas where Paylens of pure descent can be found
<BR>today are isolated communities within the Scarred Lands, the Norre Hills, and
<BR>the fringes of the Shadowfir Forest.  Paylen blood is found in 50% of the
<BR>people of Palinor, a third of the people of Restolynd, and about 15-20% of the
<BR>Darhelmish.  The Paylens are skilled craftsmen and doughty fighters, possessing
<BR>a determined nature once aroused.  Weapons and other military goods produced by
<BR>those of Paylen blood are highly sought after.
<BR>
<BR>Wungar (WUHNG-gahr):  The Wungari are a short and slender race possessing skin
<BR>tones ranging from copper to deep brown.  Their eyes are black, dark brown, and
<BR>brown while their hair is almost uniformly glossy black, though some dark brown
<BR>does occur.
<BR>
<BR>Native to the plains lying between the rivers Sehha and Zalang, the Wungari have
<BR>not spread out to thedegree that the other races have.  Indeed, the Wungari are
<BR>one of the few races that have maintained some degree of racial purity as the
<BR>nomads who roam the Plains of the Wungari and the Great Wastes of the Thule
<BR>today are the direct descents of the original nomadic tribesmen.  The Wungari
<BR>bloodline is not limited to this region alone, however.  Nearly 45% of the
<BR>people of Punt are descendants of the Wungari and an almost equal amount of
<BR>Wungari blood is found within the Kingdom of Zalango.  The Wungari are a most
<BR>fierce and warlike people and their horsemanship skills are without equal.
<BR>Peerless too are the medium horses they raise and these are highly sough after
<BR>in the southern lands.
<BR>
<BR>Wynnyc (WIHN-nick):  The Wynnics are an extremely fair people with light skins
<BR>and hair colors ranging from platinum blonde to sandy brown.  Wynnycs have eye
<BR>colors of pale green and blue and light grey and their hair is usually curly
<BR>though not overly so.
<BR>
<BR>The original Wynnyc tribesmen came from the river valley that today bears their
<BR>name, the Wynnych.  Pressure from the warlike Wungari to their south forced
<BR>migrations of Wynnycs that led to the settlement of to the north and east.
<BR>Pure blood Wynnycs are found throughout the Eastern Empire, the Principality
<BR>of Maelgawe, and the Theocracy of Astrelas, where they comprise most of the
<BR>population.  Nearly 80% of the people that dwell in the lands of Darhelm are of
<BR>Wynnyc descent and they also make up a third of bloodline of the people of
<BR>Restolynd.  Almost all of the half-elves dwelling within Luva are also of Wynnyc
<BR>heritage though they have been isolated from their kin for so long as to be more
<BR>elven than anything else.  Wynnycs are highly skilled craftsmen and traders as
<BR>well as being exceptional in the ways of the arts.  Most all skalds and bards of
<BR>any repute come from Wynnyc lands.
<BR> 
<BR>Tzambuli (TZAM-bool):  The Tzambuli are a tall and strong race, possessing of a
<BR>heavy muscular build.  Their skin tones are black to brown and their hair is
<BR>inky black, tending to be fine and straight.  The eyes of the Tzambuli are
<BR>varied, being brown and black normally but a fair amount of them have dark blue
<BR>(almost violet) or amber so bright as to seem golden: this is seen as a sign of
<BR>magic-using ability.
<BR>
<BR>The origins of the Tzambuli are shrouded in mystery and legend.  All that is
<BR>known for certain is that the first emerged from the Rethewetar Jungle close to
<BR>two hundred years before the forming of the ancient dwarven kingdom of Muzara,
<BR>though legend tells of their fleeing a great evil.  They carried their culture
<BR>and civilization intact and spread throughout the southern portion of Darengal;
<BR>only the fierce Wungari managed to keep them at bay.  The Sultanate of Jambool
<BR>is comprised exclusively of Tzambulese and their blood can also be found in
<BR>Punt where it makes up the ancestry of about 40% of the people.  Tzambuli blood
<BR>is also common in Zalango, where it is found in nearly half of the Zalangese.
<BR>The Tzambuli have an intrinsic flair for magic and have practiced it for
<BR>centuries.  They are also possessed of a cruel nature and an acquisitive
<BR>nature, making them ruthless expansionists.
