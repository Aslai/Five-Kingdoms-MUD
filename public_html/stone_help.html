STONE
<BR>
<BR> Stone giants inhabit the wilderness of Mirlan, and live by using their brute
<BR>strength to crush their prey when they hunt.  However, much as other giants,
<BR>their raw strength makes them very clumsy when it comes to avoiding attacks.
<BR>Stone giants are natural wanderers, and are often found alone in places away
<BR>from crowds.  They are largely ignorant of cities and laws. 
<BR>
<BR>Like all giants, stone giants have a size advantage over most adventurers, and
<BR>are resistant to physical attacks.  They also share with other giants an innate
<BR>mastery in bash, body slam, and enhanced damage, although their slow minds make
<BR>them vulnerable to mental attacks and spells. Having no additional resistance
<BR>they also lack any true weaknesses. They are neutral in alignment.
<BR>
<BR> Stone Giants, unlike the others possess the ability to use boulders as thrown
<BR>weapons in certain types of terrain.
<BR>
<BR> Stone giants can be the following classes:
<BR>
<BR>Warrior, Ranger, and Berserker.
