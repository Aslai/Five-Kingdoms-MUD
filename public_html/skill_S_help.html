<BR>Syntax: sense
<BR>
<BR>This skill makes it possible to sense the presence of people moving around,
<BR>making it hard to sneak past an alert user of this skill.  It also allows one
<BR>to sense presence of living things in the area though one can only distinguish
<BR>a certain number of life forms thus making it useless in crowded areas.
<BR>
<BR>Ferals have an innate ability to sense motion.

GAIN 'GAIN CONVERT' 'GAIN STUDY'
<BR>
<BR>Adventurers may ask the trainers to convert ten practice sessions into one
<BR>training session.  The ability to do this is called 'gain convert'.
<BR>
<BR>Trainers can also help adventurers change one training session into ten
<BR>practices.  To do this, find an appropriate trainer and type 'gain study'.

'SHARPMETAL'
<BR>
<BR>syntax: cast 'sharpmetal' (target)         
<BR>
<BR>When a Sorcerer uses sharpmetal, they conjure a mass of superheated metal 
<BR>shards, and send the stream of deadly metal flying towards their enemies.  
<BR>Being able to direct the spell in such way, the caster can then selectively
<BR>pick his targets only hitting those in combat with him or his group mates.
<BR>Note that different shaped shards may cause different damage, and that each
<BR>target increases the cost of spell accordingly.

'SEAR'
<BR>
<BR>syntax: cast 'sear' (target)
<BR>
<BR>A skilled Sorcerer can gather sunlight into a more focused ray and direct it 
<BR>to an opponent in a searing deadly beam.  Since little to no sunlight can be
<BR>found indoors and in dark areas, a Sorcerer can't gather the light in such 
<BR>places.  In some cases the light ray may be so intense, that it may leave the 
<BR>opponent blind for extended amount of time.

<BR>The shield of thorns creates a magical barrier of thorns to protect and

<BR>it near impossible to harm the druid without being hindered and damaged by

SEQUENCER

<BR>syntax: sequencer add (spell name)
<BR>	sequencer use
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Some of those magically inclined have found a way to inscribe a power of 
<BR>a spell into a rune held stable by arcane forces.  Thus due to rune's
<BR>ability to call forth such spells in the sequence they were stored, the
<BR>rune carries the name Sequencer.  The user may store any defensive
<BR>spell into the sequencer as long as the incantation is not too powerful.
<BR>Up to 5 cantrips may be thus stored, and released upon the will of caster
<BR>at not cost, nor delay.  Note however that the cost to store a spell into 
<BR>the rune is far more then normal.

<BR> There are those in the guild of warriors whom have spent all their life

SOUL TRANSFER
<BR>
<BR>Syntax: cast 'soul transfer' (obj)
<BR>
<BR>  After centuries of using their malformed weapons the guild of Dark Knights
<BR>devised this spell to allow transference of power from a malformed weapon
<BR>into yet untouched one.  When cast upon an object the spell will form an
<BR>unholy channel from a held malformed weapon, and transfer the souls trapped
<BR>by the vile device into the targeted weapon.  Thus the new weapon shall
<BR>receive the malformed spirit, and contain all the powers, and abilities of its
<BR>previous host, albeit at cost to its power as the transfer is not perfect.
