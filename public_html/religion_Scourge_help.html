SCOURGE
<BR>
<BR> You have always had a cruel streak.  Inflicting pain upon others has always
<BR>gotten a rise out of you, and as you aged, the hatred you have for others has
<BR>grown with you.  You skill passion for inflicting pain is only surpassed by
<BR>your skill at doing it.  You bring pain and death in your wake as you cut a
<BR>bloody swathe through your foes. 
<BR>
<BR>The walkers of this way are as many as those that they prey upon.  No caste,
<BR>race, or creed can claim any majority of them, as they come from every
<BR>religious or financial category that exists.  But one thing is consistent
<BR>among them.  A desire to destroy, and the means to do it.
