FIRE
<BR>
<BR>Fire giants are found in the mountainsides, especially in volcanic wastes.
<BR>Typically living in small villages, they often fight among themselves to
<BR>establish power and ranking within their crude communities.  Fire giants
<BR>are also known to quarrel with goblins and orcs over living space and hunting
<BR>grounds, although they are not smart enough to organize themselves to fight
<BR>full-scale wars.
<BR>
<BR>Like all giants, fire giants have a size advantage over most adventurers, and
<BR>are resistant to physical attacks.  They also share with other giants an innate
<BR>mastery in bash, body slam, and enhanced damage, although their slow minds make
<BR>them vulnerable to mental attacks and spells.  Like their name implies, fire
<BR>giants have adapted themselves to their hot surrounds, and are thus resistant to
<BR>fire, and extremely adept with any weapons made of fire, or causing fiery damage.
<BR>However, ice attacks are foreign to them, and they are vulnerable to such
<BR>attacks.  They are naturally evil.
<BR>
<BR>Fire giants can be the following classes:
<BR>
<BR>Warrior, Cleric, and Berserker.
