'CALL LIGHTNING'
<BR>
<BR>Syntax: cast 'call lightning' (target)
<BR>
<BR>Rangers and Thaumaturgists have partial control of the elements.  When the
<BR>weather is poor, they have the ability to call down lightning bolts upon their 
<BR>opponents.  The damage inflicted by this spell is a lightning-based attack, 
<BR>and any significant amount of metal/armor on the target will enhance the 
<BR>effect greatly.

<BR>Syntax: commune 'calm'
<BR>
<BR>One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the healer and cleric 
<BR>is the calm spell, which attempts to relax any aggressive creature and those in 
<BR>combat with the caster.  Successfully calmed targets will lose any violent urges 
<BR>and in case of mindless creatures stop attacks on the caster's party.  Due to 
<BR>their nature, the Undead are particularly vulnerable to this spell.
