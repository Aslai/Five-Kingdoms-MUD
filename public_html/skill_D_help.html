DEMONFIRE
<BR>
<BR>Syntax: commune demonfire (target)
<BR>
<BR>Demonfire is a spell learned by the clerics.  Shamans may commune to their gods 
<BR>and either call upon their god to bring down divine wrath from the heavens or 
<BR>to conjure forth demonic spirits of hell to assail upon their victims.  The 
<BR>wrath or the demonic spirits that are called may not be used against those 
<BR>of the same path.  If it is done, the attack will be turned against the one 
<BR>who called forth the divine powers.

DOUBLE GRIP
<BR>
<BR>Syntax: double
<BR>Syntax: double (weapon)
<BR>
<BR>Many professions have the ability to wield weapons using both hands.  Warriors
<BR>however, in their endeavor to develop differing techniques stumbled upon the
<BR>advantage of using only one weapon.  Grasping a weapon with both hands allows
<BR>a warrior to use the weapon with greater stability, obtaining greater control.
<BR>
<BR>While double gripping a weapon, a warrior would be able to do more damage than
<BR>he/she would using only one hand while making them harder to disarm.  Due to
<BR>the nature of this technique only certain types of weapon may be gripped with
<BR>two hands.  Staffs and polearms which already require the use of both hands can
<BR>still apply this technique to gain greater stability.  Using double grip without
<BR>a syntax will double grip the weapon you are wielding.  Double with a name and
<BR>you'll wield the weapon from your inventory to wield and doublegrip. 
<BR>
<BR>Note that while double gripping a weapon you still require the "two handed"
<BR>skill to control your weapon efficiently.

DUET

<BR>When bards are in the companionship of other bards, they can pick each

<BR>as their duet partner to sing in a duet.  Keep in mind that the bards sing 
<BR>on their own skill level, meaning if one person loses their concentration, 
<BR>or disturbed by other means, the duet will not take place, and only the 
<BR>first person attempting to sing the song will sing it.  The same goes for the
<BR>songs that are not able to be sang in a duet.  There are two type of 
<BR>duets, one in which both bards will have the effect of the song, at a lower 
<BR>mana cost, or one total effect which the bards will share the lower mana 
<BR>cost.  There are some other benefits in duet that the bard will need to figure 
<BR>out on their own.
