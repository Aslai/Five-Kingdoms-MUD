HALFELF HALF-ELF 'HALF ELF' HALUVANI
<BR>
<BR>In most ways, half elves emulate their elven parents.  Half elves find
<BR>themselves often times a people apart, suffering mistrust from both races
<BR>although they can themselves find comfort in either company.  Half elves
<BR>tend to find themselves making homes in either elven lands or human lands and
<BR>exist usually without incident.
<BR>
<BR>Half elves are a little bigger than their elven bloodline.  Usually conforming
<BR>to the human side in physical height.  They tend to be a little thinner and
<BR>lighter than their human parents.  
<BR>
<BR>Half elves generally have the best of both heritages.  They see very well in the
<BR>dark and their minds are like steel traps making them difficult to scan mentally.
<BR>Fleet of foot and experienced at hiding from small minded purist of the elven
<BR>and human races half elves have adapted nicely in Mirlan.
<BR>
<BR>Half elves are more prolific than their elven lines but not as much as the human
<BR>side.  A half elf may have on average one to three children each per lifetime
<BR>with little variation or exception.
