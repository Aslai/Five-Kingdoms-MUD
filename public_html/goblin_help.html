GOBLIN GOBLINS
<BR>
<BR>Goblins are the scavengers of Mirlan.  Extremely adapt at the pleasures of
<BR>looting and pillaging.  Generally they tend to stick to a tribal type society.
<BR>Goblins love to scurry around in the dead of night.  They have a keen sense of
<BR>night vision.  Goblins are one of the few evil races that do not have an
<BR>aversion to work.  Thusly, they are pretty fair miners themselves.  Most goblins
<BR>are short in stature, ranging from three to four feet tall.
<BR>
<BR>Their hides are generally a yellowish to a dull orange hue.  Normally, goblins
<BR>have reddish eyes to a very bright yellow.  There is something about their
<BR>vision that leads most goblins to prefer what humans call some pretty awful
<BR>color schemes.  Choosing drab grays, greens and stained maroons.  The theory
<BR>from some of the wiser sages of Mirlan is that their eyes are like a bees eyes.
<BR>That they see colors that are dull and muddled as bright and vibrant.  This has
<BR>also lent to the theory that because they see things in this fashion, it drives
<BR>them insane shortly after birth.  There have been instances where a goblin has
<BR>been born blind that did not find themselves consumed with hatred and evilness
<BR>which leads the scholars to believe that goblins are not evil due to their
<BR>nature but are driven insane and evil due to their genetic makeup.
<BR>
<BR>Goblins tend to dislike and hate most gnomes and dwarves.  So much so that they
<BR>will generally attack them on sight.
<BR>
<BR>Conversely, goblins are slave traders.  They find great glee in enslaving
<BR>others.  The true strength of the goblin society is their vast numbers.  This
<BR>has kept them strong as a race and while not as strong as the human populations
<BR>very close to it.
<BR>
<BR>Goblins have a very fast metabolism.  They tend to heal faster than most other
<BR>races.  Though, not quite as fast as a troll per say but indeed many a person
<BR>hath though a Goblin laid to rest and have them stand up a moment later and
<BR>catch their opponents off guard.
<BR>
<BR>Adventuring goblins are generally not afflicted with the insanity of the
<BR>visions.  Something has happened where they escaped the traditional trait of
<BR>not being able to live with the brightness of the world around them and thusly
<BR>are not usually afflicted with the insanity of goblin society.  Goblins tend
<BR>to be neutral in their respect to ethos and but morally they swing both ways.
