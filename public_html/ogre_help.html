OGRE OGRES
<BR>
<BR>Ogres are distant relatives of giants.  This is a very apparent physical
<BR>feature when you see their large size, powerful hands and physical attributes.
<BR>One of the ogres greatest strengths is the fact that they socially have no
<BR>problems with many of the other races and are more than willing to mingle with
<BR>them to further their aims, goals and objectives.  Ogre skins, if you can call
<BR>them that, generally range from a soot black to dull yellow.  The blacker the
<BR>more rare however.  Most look like they have a jaundice type sickness color to
<BR>their skins.  Some are even a sickly violet color, these are the most rare of
<BR>the race though and usually are killed at birth due to the association with
<BR>magic.  Ogres detest magic.  Even their tribal healers are under suspicion and
<BR>failure to heal a warrior usually means instant death for a tribal healer.  The
<BR>eyes of an ogre are a bit strange to most humans.  They have purplish eyes with
<BR>white pupils.  This gives them a disheartening look when they get angry.  Their
<BR>teeth are either black from the decay or when clean, which is almost never,
<BR>orange.  Their fingers and toes are shaped more like talons than the former.
<BR>
<BR>Ogres tend to lean towards the fur/hide forms of armor but again as with other
<BR>cultural norms this does not mean they cannot wear it.  It is a general racial
<BR>preference. 
<BR>
<BR>Ogres understand battle.  They are very powerful warriors and train long and
<BR>hard to be the best at fighting and melee skills.  Due to their physical
<BR>strength and high constitutions they heal a little faster from wounds sustained
<BR>in battle.  They are good at pounding opponents and if they get you off of the
<BR>ground, you may be pounded into it as they slam you down.
