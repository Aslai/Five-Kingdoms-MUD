ELF ELVEN ELVES LUVANI
<BR>
<BR>Elves are a magical race which look like thin wiry but extremely beautiful
<BR>humanoids.  There are so many different kinds of sub-races of elf such as the
<BR>valley elf, sylvan elf, wild elf, high elf, gray elf et cetera.
<BR>
<BR>Most not of the elven race cannot tell the subtle differences between the
<BR>various kinds that what is know about them is general information that tends to
<BR>be lumped together as a "common knowledge" of the elven race.  Which, elves
<BR>being aloof and not all that interested in pointing out the difference to
<BR>others as they know who is who and that is all that matters.  
<BR>
<BR>Elves are decedents of the Fae-Elves of Mirlan.  One of the oldest races in
<BR>Mirlan they tend to be a bit disconnected from the affairs of men as they have
<BR>seen mankinds cultures come and go over the untold millennia that have passed
<BR>before.
<BR>
<BR>Elves tend to be extremely quick and agile.  This makes them suitable for many
<BR>professions.  Some of the best thieves and rangers are of the elven race.
<BR>Elves, while appearing to be disconnected this is an illusion to most as they
<BR>are very in tune with the natural order of things and Gaemina's will.  Most of
<BR>what is known about the elven culture comes directly from elves themselves.
<BR>There are so many more mysteries that they keep hidden and secret, only
<BR>releasing information in general ways.  Curiously, elves do not have souls.
<BR>They are spirits contained in material forms.  Thusly, elves are believed to
<BR>re-incarnate upon their final injuries into other beings, transforming their
<BR>energies into something of the natural world.  Elves have extremely good night
<BR>vision and most times while in the homes of the forest elves cannot be tracked
<BR>or heard except by the best of the best trackers and hunters.  Due to the
<BR>common social life-styles of elves they tend to lean towards the finer artistic
<BR>aspects of life such as art, poetry, magic and musical endeavors.  This does not
<BR>limit them but over the many long ages they have adapted to this life-style and
<BR>they tend to be slightly more frail than humans.  
<BR>
<BR>Most adventuring elves come in many different colors and sizes not normally seen
<BR>in the clans of elven cultures that keep to themselves but there are many
<BR>generalities that do remain a constant to their fine race.  Usually they have
<BR>almond shaped and high brow eyes.  Their hair, while thick, is fine as silk with
<BR>a unusually high sheen to it that gives it a more pronounced vibrance to it.
<BR>They tend to be lean and slender with fingers that look more apt to play an
<BR>instrument than use in battle.  Make no mistake though, elves can be
<BR>accomplished warriors that can fight with the best of the most hardy ogres if
<BR>they are smart.
<BR>
<BR>Elves due to their nature are difficult to charm and like wise because of
<BR>their culture they tend to stay away from the cruder things like iron.
