'ICE STORM' 
<BR>
<BR>Syntax: cast 'ice storm'
<BR>
<BR>This spell conjures a storm of elements of ice and lightning, inflicting wounds
<BR>to all those in the room due to the sub-zero temperature the storm brings.  The
<BR>spell nature makes it very dependable against opponents with magical protection
<BR>against afflictive spells, and its effectiveness more then matches icicle spell
<BR>especial against those vulnerable to cold.  At times the temperature drops to
<BR>such extreme that weapons and armor may shatter from stress of combat. Only
<BR>thaumaturgists are able to learn this spell as part of their arsenal.

'FIRE SHIELD' 'ICE SHIELD'
<BR>
<BR>Syntax: cast 'fire shield'
<BR>Syntax: cast 'ice shield'
<BR>
<BR>These spells creates a magical shield of the specific element surrounding the
<BR>thaumaturgist.  The shield acts as a protective barrier from the thaumaturgist's 
<BR>opponents.  If an opponent is in combat with the thaumaturgist, there is a
<BR>chance that the shield surrounding the thaumaturgist will wound their opponent.  
<BR>Also, the shield acts as a dampening or an enhancement device against natural
<BR>elements.  Fire attacks against an thaumaturgist while he has surrounded
<BR>himself with a fire shield will enhance the attack whereas ice attacks will be
<BR>dampened and be decreased in power.  The basic thaumaturgist spells of Flame
<BR>Arrow and Icicle can be further enhanced in power by the shield of their
<BR>respective elements.
