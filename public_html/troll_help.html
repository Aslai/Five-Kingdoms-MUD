TROLL TROLLS
<BR>
<BR>Trolls, some of the most vile and evil creatures to walk Mirlan.  Without care
<BR>or concern they devastate without discrimination.  Trolls can be found in
<BR>almost any climb or climate except for extreme colds.  
<BR>
<BR>These demi-humans are a subrace of giants as well.  Long, long ago they shared
<BR>a common bloodline but somewhere in the reaches of antiquity their vileness
<BR>twisted them in barely humanoid forms.  Bandy legs, taught skin, and claws
<BR>these creatures wreck havoc all over the lands.  
<BR>
<BR>Highly resistant to some forms of attack they really have only one true
<BR>weakness.  Fire.  Trolls hate fire.  
<BR>
<BR>Their extreme constitutions and metabolism lends them the ability to regenerate
<BR>naturally at high rates.  These creatures are not very smart or wise except in
<BR>cunning ways which has led to more than one persons demise for underestimating
<BR>their guile and tenacity.
<BR>
<BR>Trolls tend to have mossy or molted green hides to putrid gray.  Their hair is
<BR>more of a greenish black to dull gray.  They have dead black eyes and can see
<BR>their prey well in the deep of the night.  
<BR>
<BR>They have very good senses of smell and oft times this is what gives a hiding
<BR>opponent away to their overly sensitive keen smelling abilities.  Trolls are
<BR>not afraid of anything or anyone in general.
<BR>
<BR>Not much is really known about the troll societies except that generally they
<BR>prefer to travel alone or with one or two others of their kind.  For the most
<BR>part they are solitary beasts.  They have claws as opposed to fingers and toes
<BR>which are very sharp and dangerous when used in combat.
