DROW  LUTHARNI
<BR>
<BR>Drow are the dark skinned cousins of elves.  Driven centuries ago below the
<BR>lands into caverns and what some call "the underdark" by an eons long war with
<BR>the elven people they grew to hate.  Their hate twisted into an evil born of
<BR>ultimate revenge and associations with the creatures that inhabit the underworld
<BR>of Mirlan.  Long have they plotted and planned revenge upon the elven nations
<BR>and all those races that helped them.  Originally they were not evil, but over
<BR>the eons of time they transformed into twisted visages of the elf.  Their
<BR>natural magical entities adapted to the dark.  Their infravision and other
<BR>senses grew in power while some of the other natural abilities subsided and
<BR>faded.  They gained immunities to certain things and vulnerabilities to others.
<BR>The one thing that remained constant with them and their elf-brethren is their
<BR>quickness and ability to use magic.
<BR>
<BR>The drow race in general are usually always evil.  The centuries of removal from
<BR>the upper realms of Mirlan have twisted their thinking and jaded their outlook
<BR>to all but their own kind.  While they will cooperate with many races, to see
<BR>a drow and an elf in the same company is a rare thing indeed and usually some
<BR>deceit or trickery is at hand.
<BR>
<BR>The drow stock tend to be slightly thinner than their elf cousins.  Usually,
<BR>platinum or pure snow white hair with sharp drawn eyes with high arched brows.
<BR>A tell tale signature physical appearance is their thin wispy lips that are as
<BR>ebony as their skin.
<BR>
<BR>Any drow that is found above ground is usually an outcast drow of the deeply
<BR>hidden society.  Much of the racial abilities of a drow are lost when they
<BR>venture too long from their homeland, never to regain them.  Many times this
<BR>drives the drow insane and to become even more vile and twisted in their evil.
<BR>Taking out on others their pain and loss.  Outcasts of the drow society are
<BR>usually the adventuring type.  
<BR>
<BR>They tend to stay away from silver and mithril items and are not as susceptible
<BR>to being charmed and very hard to detect coming up behind you, making these
<BR>creatures very good thieves and practitioners of the darker arts and
<BR>professions.
