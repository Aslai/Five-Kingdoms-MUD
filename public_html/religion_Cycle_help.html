CYCLE
<BR>
<BR>Death is the great beyond.  Once you pass through it's arches, never again will
<BR>you return.  Or will you?  The cycle of life is a cycle of death.  From death
<BR>have you came, and so shall you return to it.  There is no avoiding your fate,
<BR>so why bother trying.  You perpetuate the cycle by bringing death to those
<BR>whose time has run out, albeit in your eyes, or those of your God. 
<BR>
<BR>Those of the Cycle do not kill out of pure lust or acquisition of power.  They
<BR>do so to reclaim souls to add to the pyre, and perpetuate the endless cycle of
<BR>death and life.  To attempt to cheat death is folly, and so long as these
<BR>people exist, it can be most dangerous as well.
