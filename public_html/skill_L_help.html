LORE
<BR>
<BR>Syntax: lore (object)
<BR>
<BR>Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends.
<BR>Use of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object, 
<BR>concerning its power and uses.  While those with great intellect and wisdom
<BR>have natural affinity for this skill, a lucky fool has been known to give 
<BR>better readings then a learned Mage.  Bards due to their extensive worldly
<BR>knowledge always get a perfect lore reading.  When using the lore skill you
<BR>will get a general idea of the object's origins.

LURE

<BR>following them.  Note that at no time will the target be under the bard's
<BR>control, but instead compelled to follow him elsewhere so they might fight
<BR>in privacy.

LEECH
<BR>
<BR>Illithids have a special skill, in which they wrap their tentacles around the
<BR>victim's head, and run an electric current through their tentacles which
<BR>penetrates the victims skull.  Specialized sensors at the tips of the tentacles
<BR>reads the feedback of the electric currents and if successful they are able to
<BR>steal the victim's memory temporarily.  The memory is not lost from the victim.
<BR>However, the shock to the head have a chance of causing disorientation to the
<BR>victim. With this skill, Illithids can gain temporary proficiency of spells
<BR>from sorcerers, thaumaturgists, necromancers and psions.  Due to the enormous
<BR>strain it takes to retain the memory, the Illithid will be drained for a short
<BR>while after the affects have worn off.
<BR>
<BR>Only the more experienced Illithids can use this skill.

<BR>while within natures embrace. Healers of the land are known to call it
<BR>Gaemina's blessing, and natures sanctuary.
