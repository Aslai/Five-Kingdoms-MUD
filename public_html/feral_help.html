FERAL
<BR>
<BR>Through the taint of magic from a long since forgotten Arch-Mage a tribe of
<BR>of people who lived not too far from the mages strong hold were used in
<BR>experiments of this evil lord.  
<BR>
<BR>After hundreds of years of genetic manipulation, torture and mental assault
<BR>on the minds of these people their bodies and minds began to evolve into a 
<BR>more animalistic form.  With the physical change came mental changes as well.
<BR>
<BR>These people once known as the Ferishalli became known simply as "The Feral."
<BR>
<BR>A strong leader came to sit on the Feral's council and convinced the Feral to
<BR>rise up against this dark arch mage and free themselves from his slavery and 
<BR>torture.  The struggle was monumental.  Lasting but a few short hours the
<BR>Feral eventually overcame the arch mage at a high price.  Nearly all had been
<BR>destroyed and nearly wiped out completely.  The battle took men, women and
<BR>children alike.  Leaving but a few of the younger of the tribe behind.
<BR>
<BR>Soon after the battle, the tribe disbanded.  Heated arguments over how best
<BR>to run the tribe and who would be the new leaders broke this once strong and
<BR>ancient people up.  Now, over the hundreds of years of freedom, Feral have
<BR>become very bent on keeping their individual freedoms.  Tribe mentality all
<BR>but washed from their way of thinking.
<BR>
<BR>Feral can be the following classes: 
<BR>
<BR>Warrior, Ranger, Thief, Cleric, and Shaman
