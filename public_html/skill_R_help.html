<BR>
<BR>Once you start a fight you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight is not
<BR>going well you can attempt to FLEE or another character can attempt to RESCUE
<BR>you.  You may use spells such as "word of recall" or "gate" to transport you
<BR>out of battle.
<BR>
<BR>If you lose your link during a fight your character will keep fighting and will
<BR>attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances of making the recall are
<BR>reduced and you will lose much more experience.

<BR>RESCUE
<BR>
<BR>Syntax: rescue (target)
<BR>
<BR>When in combat, a warrior or a paladin may rescue their friends who are
<BR>in trouble.  Rescue allows you to intercede in combat, protecting weaker
<BR>characters from bodily harm.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill
<BR>rating, as well as a comparison of level, dexterity, and speed between 
<BR>the character and the target.  Only warriors and paladins may learn to 
<BR>rescue their friends.

RAGE
<BR>
<BR>Syntax: rage
<BR>
<BR>Berserker, with their rash approach to combat, are known to be overwhelmed 
<BR>by madness during combat.  During this madness, they  are able to withstand 
<BR>more damage than they normally would, and can inflict a massive amount of 
<BR>damage at the same time.  They also have an immense thirst to fight that 
<BR>is only quenched at the death of a victim.  Thus, if his original opponent 
<BR>flees, he would attack the next person he sees.  Once out of this state of 
<BR>madness, the berserker returns to his original state.  He can no longer 
<BR>sustain the extraordinary amount of damage he can before, thus if he had
<BR>withstand more than his regular damage, he would go into shock and pass into 
<BR>unconsciousness.  Only the natural health of a berserker can revive him at 
<BR>this point.  Those that are naturally more healthy, may eventually recover. 
<BR>
<BR>When born, the berserker's rage is unfocused and only offers a small fraction
<BR>of its capability until the berserker chooses a focus for his deadly tide of
<BR>rage through Path Focus.  At this point his choice will determine the style
<BR>and ability of his rage and further fruition into more skills late in his
<BR>career.

RELAX
<BR>
<BR>Syntax: relax
<BR>
<BR>While berserkers are known for going into a state of madness, they have also 
<BR>developed an ability to try to compensate their temper.  Relax allows them to
<BR>calm down and snap out of that state of madness.  Unless the berserker has 
<BR>chosen the path of anger it has a very small chance of succeeding, although at
<BR>times, it's worth a try.  Those berserkers at higher ranks and have gathered 
<BR>more experience in their traveling would have a better chance at controlling 
<BR>their madness than those who are young and inexperienced. 
<BR>
<BR>Those berserkers whom are skilled in the path of anger will always relax,
<BR>even during combat (a feat beyond the skill of other paths), and take only 
<BR>a fraction of the timer required for their brethren
