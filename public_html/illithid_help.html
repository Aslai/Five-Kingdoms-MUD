ILLITHID ILLITH MIND FLAYER
<BR>Illithids are an evil race of subterranean creatures who are accomplished
<BR>sorcerers and very adept at necromancy.  They possess an intelligence and
<BR>wisdom to match almost any other race above or below the surface.
<BR>
<BR>With their extraordinary capabilities in these arts they are a very dominate
<BR>force below the surface of Mirlan.
<BR>
<BR>They have innate abilities that make them difficult to face down with magic.
<BR>However, due to their nearly exclusive magical abilities they suffer from most
<BR>common physical attacks except for one.  Due to their highly rubbery skins,
<BR>maces and the like do not tend to harm them nearly as much as other races.  
<BR>
<BR>When in extremes they have the ability to enter a trance like state which helps
<BR>them ward off death. 
<BR>
<BR>Physically the Illithid has a mauve-like skin tone to them, large praying mantis
<BR>like eyes and tentacles.  Usually the tentacles are indicative of an illithids
<BR>age.  Generally, they are born with three and gain a tentacle every ten or so
<BR>years.  This is a general rule of thumb as is with all creatures, nature can
<BR>sometimes play cruel jokes on races.  They are bipedal and in other respects
<BR>look like any other humanoid. All Illithids are bald with cone shaped heads.
<BR>They are without exception devoid of hair.  This has led some researchers to
<BR>believe that the Illithids are not mammalian but more amphibian in nature.
<BR>
<BR>Illithids have acquired a unique talent for feeding.  They use the tentacles to
<BR>stun and suck in their prey.  Illithids cannot wield weapons, except for the
<BR>weapons of the necromancer or sorcerers.  
<BR>
<BR>Nothing is known of the social and reproductive habits of the illithids as most
<BR>who try and find out, find themselves dead or worse, a slave of these vile
<BR>creatures.  They are known to have a great society beneath the depths of Mirlan
<BR>and that they are very well organized and capable of launching large assaults
<BR>when they desire.
