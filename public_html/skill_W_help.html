WEAKEN
<BR>
<BR>Syntax: cast 'weaken' (target)
<BR>Syntax: commune 'weaken' (target)
<BR>
<BR>The weaken spell will drastically weaken the victim for several hours.  This
<BR>affect often causes the victim to drop their weapons, due to the lack of
<BR>strength to hold it.  As the caster rise up in rank, the affect of this spell
<BR>also becomes stronger, making the strength loss in the victim even more evident.

WHIP

<BR>These weapons maybe as simple as a length of leather or as

<BR>impossible to avoid.
<BR>
<BR>Whips are more offensive and harder to defend with then axes.
<BR>They disarm better then exotics, shield-disarm better then axes 
<BR>and are harder to disarm then exotics.

WRATH
<BR>
<BR>Syntax: commune 'wrath' (target)
<BR>
<BR>Paladins have the ability to call upon the gods of light to strike down the foes
<BR>of the caster with divine wrath.  This wrath is most effective against those who
<BR>walk in darkness and less effective against those who do not have a firm moral
<BR>commitment.  One should notice that this potent prayer quickly loses its power
<BR>against those seriously hurt or near death.

WANTED

<BR>in Mirlan's Jails.  
<BR>
<BR> The amount of time which you will be wanted depends on which town you are
<BR>convicted in.  What is considered an atrocity in one city may be a petty
<BR>offense in another.  The amount of time will be displayed by typing 'score'.
<BR>Keep in mind that those who repeatedly break the law will soon find themselves
<BR>outlaws.
