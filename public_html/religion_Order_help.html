ORDER
<BR>
<BR>Without law, you are nothing more than the animals.  Slave to Disorder.  Law
<BR>and Order are the only thing that raises us above them, good and evil does
<BR>not matter; all are the same before it.  Ruling with an iron fist or
<BR>creating a civilization that favors neither good nor evil, the law is a tool
<BR>to control, to protect, and to gain.  Use it at your whim, but do not falter.
<BR>
<BR>The world is ripe with disorder.  Order is the shield that protects the
<BR>world's population from destruction.  Before it's blind eye, all are equal. 
<BR>The immoral murderer and the pious preacher; all will benefit, and heed,
<BR>it's guidelines.  It favors nothing, but elevates itself above all.  It
<BR>looks down on none, but is superior to everything else.  It is the only
<BR>thing that matters.  But, just as laws are tools, so shall people use them
<BR>to their advantage.  Many who live the Way of Order know what they may or
<BR>may not be able to get away with, and often corrupt the law to further their
<BR>own goals, be it for good or evil.

<BR>[ <font color=#FFFFFF>LAW</font> ] - The Pillar of Law
<BR>
<BR>The cabal of Law is perhaps the most visible, revered, and hated
<BR>cabal in Mirlan. They are the servants of the society, the judges,
<BR>jury, and executioners of those who would walk a path that would be
<BR>contrary to public good. They are devoted and stalwart servants,
<BR>and have a keen and sharp understanding of the laws of the nations,
<BR>as well as a thick skin to battle off naysayers.
<BR>
<BR>The Pillar of Law is comprised of two separate clans:
<BR>
<BR>The Enforcers   - These lawmen chase fugitives, and sentence
<BR>The Magistrates - These lawmen are protectors of the homeland
<BR>
<BR>The Pillar of Law is a highly sought after cabal, one that requires
<BR>cunning, speed, diligence, and intellect. As such, only those who
<BR>are law abiding citizens, and not natively forest denizens may
<BR>apply to the Law cabal.
<BR>
<BR>If you are interested in applying to the Pillar of Law, submit
<BR>your application to LAW.
