GNOME GNOMES LAMMEN
<BR>
<BR>Gnomes are an interesting race.  They are short like a dwarf but not as thick
<BR>or broad shouldered.  They tend to be able to dabble in the magical arts much
<BR>more aptly than dwarves.  Sahaeyeh and Madshem begot the Fey-Gnomes and in time
<BR>became gnomes.  While looking similar the dwarves and the gnomes are not related
<BR>racially.  
<BR>
<BR>Gnomes prefer hilly regions and burrows.  Highly capable and much sought after
<BR>are gnomish inventions and skills in gemsmithing.  They are masters in general
<BR>of this particular trade and when a gnome takes it up as a profession there are
<BR>very few indeed who can match their skills.  Shifty and cunning, nimble and
<BR>quick of feet gnomes gain respect with their inborn abilities as rangers of
<BR>excellence and many a person has lost their person to the deft hands of a
<BR>gnomish thief.  
<BR>
<BR>Gnomes tend to be jovial and serious at the same time.  Some feel that they are
<BR>rather greedy when it comes to material possessions as a rule of thumb but this
<BR>is largely a misinterpretation of their normal desire to acquire wealth for the
<BR>later retirement years, hopefully according to one wise gnomish sage, at a young
<BR>enough age to be able to rather enjoy the quiet and peace to tinker with their
<BR>inventions.
<BR>
<BR>Gnomes are also some of the wisest creatures in Mirlan.  They are said to be the
<BR>very best sages and wisemen. Combined with their high intelligence, gnomes make
<BR>formidable foes when hard pressed into battle.  Mostly they are a peace loving
<BR>and unconcerned in the affairs of others.  They tend to stay out of the whole
<BR>idealistic struggle between chaos and order, preferring instead to remain
<BR>neutral as they see it to be the best advantage to be able to bargain and work
<BR>with all Choosing of course whom they will based on their needs at the time
<BR>without having to follow the dictates of petty ethos of chaotic or lawfulness.
<BR>
<BR>Gnomes tend to have rather pronounced noses.  Near comical. With a usually
<BR>darker tanned skin which is natural, not sun caused, and coarse hair which
<BR>they tend to braid like the dwarven people.  Their skin is not as tough as
<BR>most races, this makes their kind try and avoid being bashed around a lot.  One
<BR>of the reasons note too many gnomish warriors exist although, there are a few.
<BR>Most gnomes prefer finesse and skill opposed to brute force.  Gnomes over time
<BR>developed the ability to see in the dark from generations of gnome clans
<BR>digging in the mines for precious stones and the creation of fine jewelry.
