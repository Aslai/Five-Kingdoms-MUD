DUERGAR  DARK DWARF MURZA
<BR>
<BR>Many centuries ago, some dwarves sided with what are now known as the drow
<BR>people in an epic battle between the races.  The reasons for the war long lost
<BR>to antiquity and forgotten.  All that remains of this terrible war are the races
<BR>that came of that war.  Driven deep into mountain caverns.  The duergar were
<BR>continually pursued in the genocide mentality of the factions that fought them.
<BR>They used their natural abilities of mining and tunnel digging to burrow deep
<BR>into the world.  Eventually finding a whole other world beneath the surface
<BR>that had been carved out of millions of years of underground rivers and
<BR>fantastic creatures that call the depths of Mirlan's soil home.  They found
<BR>themselves once again allied with their former comrades in arms in the drow.
<BR>
<BR>The duergar much like the drow sought revenge and to this end found the drow
<BR>useful allies.
<BR>
<BR>Long years of cultural changes and the effects of losing to their above surface
<BR>enemies tainted these once benign people into a reverse image of there dwarf
<BR>brothers and sisters.  Their skin became an ashy-white for the most part and
<BR>their eyes tended to grow even more acutely aware of their dark surroundings
<BR>giving them extremely good vision in the deep dark of the underworld.  Their
<BR>eyes transformed into pupiless orbs of milky white giving them spooky blank
<BR>expression when gazed upon.  
<BR>
<BR>Something happened as history tells it, between the duergar and the drow and it
<BR>is widely believed that evil turns upon evil which gave way to the discord
<BR>between the two races.  While they still cooperate with each other is it out of
<BR>need and not out of a desire to socialize with each other.  Widely known that
<BR>the other creatures and races of the underworld can be dangerous to encounter
<BR>the more intelligent races such as the duergar put old scars behind them in
<BR>favor of survival when clans such as the Illithid rise in power below.  
<BR>
<BR>The duergar adventuring race are mostly males.  While there are a few female
<BR>duergar adventurers they are few and far between.  Duergar that leave their
<BR>ancestral homes lose many of their innate abilities but they do retain a few.
<BR>Wildly believe to be fierce fighters they have been called berserking fiends of
<BR>the underworld.  They make excellent warriors and thieves as well as berserkers.
<BR>Occasionally a powerful duergar will become a dreaded shaman.  Lo to those that
<BR>cross such a person.  The outcast duergar are generally always evil and very
<BR>maliciously conniving.  
<BR>
<BR>Duergar do not handle magic well and tend to shun such arts and professions
<BR>however, due to their high constitutions they are resilient to it as well as
<BR>natural poisons.  As dwarves are prone to avoid water so too are the duergar
<BR>as they are shaped much like their dwarf brothers and tend to sink quickly once
<BR>immersed in water.
