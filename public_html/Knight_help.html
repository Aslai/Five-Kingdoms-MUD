[ <font color=#FFFF00>KNIGHT</font> ] - The Knights of the Realm
<BR>
<BR>The embodiment of all that is good and just in the world of Mirlan,
<BR>the Knights are the sword of truth, the eyes of Good. They advocate
<BR>the path of the light, often with sword so stalwartly, that are seldom
<BR>swayed. Their conviction is so defined and strong, that even the most
<BR>powerful of evils are often shed off by the Knights. It is their will
<BR>and mission to cleanse the lands of the taints of the Evil Gods, and
<BR>keep harmony, peace, and happiness prevalent in Mirlan.
<BR>
<BR>The Knights of the Realm are comprised of three separate clans:
<BR>
<BR>Order of the Golden Griffons  
<BR>Royal Order of Esterian Knights
<BR>The Knights of the Sword and Cross
<BR>
<BR>Knights are consummate fighters, who tend to be clever witted with
<BR>keen senses, especially in the heat of combat. They are expect to fight
<BR>strongly for their beliefs, and back down from no foe. They are expected
<BR>to fight with honor and courage in all situations. and to defend the
<BR>name and rights of their clans to the death, if required.
<BR>
<BR>Because of the nature of this cabal, you must serve only the Gods of
<BR>Good, and be one of the Cavalier, Paladin, Ranger, Healer, Cleric, or
<BR>Crusader guilds.
