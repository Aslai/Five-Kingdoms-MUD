DWARF DWARVES DWARVEN MUZ
<BR>
<BR>Dwarves resemble short, broad-shouldered, stocky humans.  They are extremely
<BR>hardy and resist many things that would kill a human because of their
<BR>constitutions.  As a race they are extremely hard working and stout with a
<BR>generality of ale lovers.  They usually appear to other races as greedy, dour
<BR>and taciturn but this is a misplaced observation of those who do not understand
<BR>dwarven society.  They are very social with their own kind and can tell and take
<BR>a joke with the best of them so long.... as it comes from another dwarf.  They
<BR>frown up other races most times because of their usual serious nature towards
<BR>work and work ethics.
<BR>
<BR>Usually once a dwarf has been made a friend they are a friend for life.  These
<BR>long bearded and stout people lean towards lawfulness and goodness while not
<BR>being restricted to these ideals and moralities.  Generally, when found out in
<BR>the Mirlan adventuring they do not stick to patterns of normality.  While, they
<BR>do tend to stay from the evil alignments, this does not preclude them from them
<BR>either.  They can be just as evil and cunning as the most vile drow.  While
<BR>hardy and able to see in the dark due to their stocky thick core they do not
<BR>deal well with water and no dwarf has been known to be able to tread water for
<BR>very long.  Muscle does not float as well as fat.  A fact most dwarves are
<BR>acutely aware of.
