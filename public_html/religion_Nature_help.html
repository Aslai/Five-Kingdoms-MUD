NATURE
<BR>
<BR>None are so at home within the wild as you.  You have been raised among the
<BR>trees, and from the sway of their limbs, you have learned that which will
<BR>sustain you, and that which will kill you.  Within your forest home, you are
<BR>master, and there is nothing that eludes your attention.  Much like the
<BR>creatures that you share the forest with, it is kill or be killed, and you
<BR>know how to do it.  
<BR>
<BR>Rangers and druids are most often followers of the Way of Nature for obvious
<BR>reasons, but just because they wield abilities granted to them by Gaeamina, it
<BR>does not exclude others.
<BR>
<BR>All of these have discovered the secrets concealed within the grass, hidden
<BR>within the brush, and cloaked within the canopy.  With these at their beckon
<BR>call, they make formidable opponents.
