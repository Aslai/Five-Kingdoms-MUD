HALFLING HALFLINGS MOICHEN
<BR>
<BR>Halflings are short, generally plump people, very much like small humans,
<BR>averaging 3 and 1/2 feet tall.  Their faces are round and broad and often quite
<BR>florid.  Their hair typically curly and the tops of  their feet are covered
<BR>with coarse hair.  Their typical life expectancy is approximately 150 years.
<BR>
<BR>Halflings are sturdy and industrious, generally quiet and peaceful. Overall
<BR>they prefer the comforts of home to dangerous adventuring.  However, though
<BR>they may never look for adventure, they have a strange knack for stumbling
<BR>across them.  And, more than occasionally, adventure finds them.  Because of
<BR>their lives filled with collecting comforts and trinkets, they have the benefit
<BR>of above average wisdom, a result of their life experiences.
<BR>
<BR>Halflings are not forward, but they are observant and conversational if in
<BR>friendly company.  They see wealth only as a means of gaining creature comforts
<BR>which they love.  Although Halflings are about the same height as gnomes, their
<BR>stout and sturdy build gives them a hearty constitution.  And, because of their
<BR>size and light weight as well as their peace loving nature, they've grown
<BR>amazingly agile and dextrous, able to dodge many of the attacks of those who
<BR>seek to harm them.  Halflings make excellent thieves, as they seek to avoid
<BR>direct conflicts by relying on their speed and agility to get them out of
<BR>dangerous situations.  They are lacking, however, in strength, due to their
<BR>small size and peaceful lifestyles.
<BR>
<BR>Elves generally like Halflings in a patronizing sort of way.  Dwarves cheerfully
<BR>tolerate them, thinking halflings somewhat soft and harmless.  Gnomes, although
<BR>they drink more and eat less, like halflings best, feeling them kindred spirits.
<BR>Halflings are more open and outgoing than any of the above races, so they get
<BR>along with other races far better.
