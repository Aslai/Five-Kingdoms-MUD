'MAGIC MISSILE'
<BR>
<BR>Syntax: cast 'magic missile' (target)
<BR>
<BR>The magic missile spell creates a magic missile that the caster may direct
<BR>toward his opponents, inflicting wounds against his opponents.  This spell is
<BR>taught to very young spell students, thus not very powerful in nature. However,
<BR>the spell does increase in power as the caster rise in ranks, although never
<BR>reaching to a very feared state.

<BR>
<BR>It has always been said the lifeblood of a mage is not what courses through
<BR>his veins, but rather his source of mana - for what is a mage without his
<BR>powers.  Thaumaturgists, being masters of harnessing and channeling energy
<BR>through their bodies, have developed the ability to compensate for their costly
<BR>spells by tearing into their physical bodies, sacrificing life blood to regain
<BR>their invaluable mana.  This is a risky procedure, and be warned, it has been
<BR>the demise of countless many who've tried to sacrifice it all for the sake of

<BR>This spell surrounds the caster with a shield of pure energy.  The shield

<BR>the upkeep of this spell is very stressful.  The caster would have to put in 
<BR>more mental energy every time a magical attack is directed at him in order 
<BR>to deflect the damage toward him.  The efficiency of the upkeep increases 
<BR>as the caster rise in rank.

<BR>A Sorcerer may call forth to the heavens and summon fiery rocks, guiding them

<BR>Since the Sorcerer has no control over the rocks, they could hit anyone near 
<BR>or no one.  The number and size of the rocks summoned is directly affected by 
<BR>casters rank and power.  While the group mates of the caster are protected, the
<BR>caster himself is not.  The only known way to prevent damage to the summoner is
<BR>known to Sorcerers who erect powerful force fields to negate the damage.

<BR>Once rangers have gained sufficient knowledge of the forest and their

<BR>ability allows the ranger to better communicate with the beasts that 
<BR>he has called to his aid.  By exploiting the abilities of these beasts

<BR>'Control leopard'  
<BR>
<BR>This allows the ranger to take over all functions of a leopard, 
<BR>allowing ranger to become leopard.  However, this leaves the body 
<BR>vulnerable and unprotected.  Also, if the ranger does not return to 
<BR>the body within six ticks as shown by the affect of mind link, the 
<BR>body will cease all life support, taking the mind with it.
<BR>
<BR>'Break'  Allows the ranger to return to his body.
<BR>
<BR>With mind link, other animals have extra abilities enabled. Displacer 
<BR>beasts will sacrifice themselves in place of their master while being
