[ <font color=#B4B400>BATTLE </font>] - The Order of the Titans
<BR>
<BR>By Titans the are called, and by Titans they behave. The Order of the
<BR>Titans is an organization of the most fearsome combatants in the land.
<BR>They are swordsmen, warlord, warriors, fighters and knights. They are
<BR>those who require no magic to assist them in their endeavors to become
<BR>the most powerful force in the land. A wide array of people reside within
<BR>the Order; Retired battlefield generals, young knights trying to make a
<BR>name, bar brawlers, and street fighters alike. They have honed their skill
<BR>and abilities in such a way that they perhaps the most formidable band
<BR>of combatants the land has seen. Oh, and they loathe magic...
<BR>
<BR>The Order of the Titans is comprised of two separate clans:
<BR>
<BR>The Savages  - Berserkers and unorthodox fighters call this clan home.
<BR>The Generals - Tacticians and precision fighters enjoy this clan.
<BR>
<BR>Because of their nature, no practitioner of magic may call the Order
<BR>home. This leaves only those of the Warrior, Paladin, Cavalier, Berserker,
<BR>Paladin, or Thief guilds as participants. Alignment and ethos are
<BR>seldom important.
<BR>
<BR>If you are interested in applying to the Order, submit your 
<BR>application to BATTLE.
