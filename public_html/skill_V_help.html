<A NAME="voodoo"></A><BR></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#c0c0c0">
VOODOO DOLL
<BR>
<BR>The art of voodoo is one practiced by high-level shamans.  The shaman uses the
<BR>dark arcane arts to bring harm to their enemies over great distances.
<BR>
<BR>MAKING A VOODOO DOLL
<BR>To first bring harm to an enemy, the shaman must first make a voodoo doll.  To
<BR>do so, the shaman must choose a target.  Once the target is found, they must
<BR>create a doll by using the following syntax:  voodoo create (target).
<BR>
<BR>USING A VOODOO DOLL
<BR>After a voodoo doll is made of the target, the shaman may then use it to bring
<BR>harm to their target.  The shaman may bring weaken, curse, plague, poison, hex,
<BR>harm, insomnia, blindness, and enfeeblement onto the victim.  To place such a
<BR>burden, use the following syntax: 
<BR>
<BR>voodoo place (target) (spell).
<BR>
<BR>Since this making a doll takes time, many moons may pass before a shaman can
<BR>make another.  Also dolls are rare, and as such are subject to the rare limit
<BR>of your inventory (one less then your rank divided by 10).

<BR>marking a victim's soul for a servant bound to their purpose.  The demonic
<BR>forces called by the communer will travel towards their marked pray wrecking
<BR>their bloody vengeance upon them.  Few are those who have been marked in such
<BR>fashion and live without nightmares of terrible visitations by spirits of
<BR>darkness.
