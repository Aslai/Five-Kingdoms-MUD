<BR>
<BR> Faith is for the weak.  People tell of the grandeur of these Gods, but
<BR>you know the truth, the wool hasn't been pulled over your eyes.  While you
<BR>do acknowledge the existence of these higher powers, you owe them no love. 
<BR>They use mortals as pawns, in a cosmic chess game.  They use you as tools to
<BR>gain what they wish.  Spoiled brats is what they are.  Too used to getting
<BR>there own way.  Separate yourself from them, sever all ties.  You want
<BR>power?  You want favor?  Rely on none but yourself, and show the heavens
<BR>that their aid is both unwanted, and unnecessary. 
<BR>
<BR>Everyone is a tool, just most people don't know it.  There are some who
<BR>claim to have their eyes open, but they're the blindest of them all.  If
<BR>they only saw that the power was already within them, they could cast off
<BR>their shackles and be free of Immortal Will.  The Gods resort to underhanded
<BR>tricks and the strategic manipulation of mortal men and women to achieve their
<BR>goals.  Is this not slavery?  The time of slavery has ended, and the age of
<BR>true freedom is at hand.   
<BR>
<BR>NOTICE:  THOSE WHO CHOOSE THIS FAITH WILL BE UNABLE TO COMMUNE.
