'ENCHANT ARMOR'
<BR> 
<BR>Syntax: cast 'enchant armor' (object)
<BR> 
<BR>The enchant armor spell imbues armor with powerful protective magic.  It is not
<BR>nearly as reliable as enchanting weapons, being far more prone to destructive 
<BR>effects.  Each successful enchant increases the protection from the armor, thus
<BR>deeming the item more powerful than before.

'ENCHANT WEAPON'
<BR> 
<BR>Syntax: cast 'enchant weapon' (object)
<BR> 
<BR>The enchant weapon spell magically enchants a weapon, increasing the power of
<BR>the weapon.  Multiple enchants may be cast, but as the weapon grows more and
<BR>more powerful, it is more likely to be drained or destroyed by the magic.  
<BR>Also, every successful enchant renders the weapon more powerful, thus 
<BR>considered higher in rank.

<BR>
<BR>Necromancers and dark-knights learn energy drain as part of their training. 
<BR>This spell allows the caster to magically sap a small amount of health, 
<BR>but most importantly, it saps the victim of his mental energy and physical 
<BR>energy, hindering his ability to cast spells and move around.  This spell 
<BR>also drains some experience from the victim, relieving him of some of the 
<BR>experiences that he had gained throughout his journey.

<BR>
<BR>Syntax: AUTOMATIC
<BR>
<BR>Warriors, thieves, rangers, berserkers, dark-knights, and paladins can become
<BR>skilled enough in combat that they are able to inflict more damage than regular
<BR>attacks.  Enhanced damage is checked for with each hit, although with a low
<BR>skill, the chance of receiving a bonus is very low indeed. Warriors, thieves,
<BR>rangers, berserkers, dark-knights, and paladins may learn to fight with
<BR>enhanced damage.
